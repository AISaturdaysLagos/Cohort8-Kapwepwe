Ravi Pradeep P,Simply the best,"44 has been my favorite restaurant ever since they were at Awolowo Road. No doubt 44 at Ikoyi Club was the best, but this is still real good. I know people who have left Lagos for good, but still ask me about 44.",30,Feb-18,4,Double Four VI
OyinOni,Hubby approved,Nice atmosphere to get away from the noice out there. Hubby had curry with rice and he loved it. A bit pricey I must say ðŸ˜Š,50,Mar-18,4,Double Four VI
gcxotf,Total wipe out!,"Dinner Saturday night, only one table in the patio and none inside. Food quality has come down, new competition in Lagos must be the reason. Price high for quality & quantity of food. In other words won't repeat in the future.",40,Jan-18,4,Double Four VI
adey_naija,"Great Food, Space Needs Attention","I have been a fan of 44 since their days on Awolowo road. Their club sandwich was the first i ever ate and I have continues to measure club sandwiches against theirs

I also love eating their fish and chips.It is a great family friendly...restaurant and have consistently served great tasting meals for the last 17 years that I have known them. 

I think they have to do something about the tired decour in the restaurant in the Palms.More",20,Mar-17,4,Double Four VI
darkchild_20,Very chilled spot,"I havenâ€™t been to the palms in a while in Lagos as I now tend to stay on the mainland anytime I am in town. I would like to say, the food here was exquisite. The waiters where lovely and professional. The music and ambience...created was one of the best I have seen on this front. 
I would tell who ever the chef is to keep it up.  For the price given , meals taken there are worth it. 
Will definitely come by to eat again before I travel out.More",40,Oct-17,4,Double Four VI
chijiokeo307,Nice ambience,"Located within the palms mall on the island, 44 restaurant caters to a range of food buffs local and international. Food is good, price is right though the staff can be funny at times. Good ambience.",50,Oct-17,4,Double Four VI
Evetstravelfun,Great lunch!,Was pleasantly surprised to find this place today. My husband and I had Cobb salad and the Chicago Burger.  Both were very tasty.  I was most impressed with how fresh the salad was. We both Like the atmosphere of the restaurant. Customer service was ok......I think we had someone new. Will go again. Recommend because of the variety on the menu. I believe the restaurant may have a new name.More,30,Jul-17,4,Double Four VI
Ian L,The best club sandwich in town,That's right - get the club sandwich. And a coke. Or a soda. Or juice. Or whatever. But get the club sandwich. Because it's amazing.,40,Jan-17,4,Double Four VI

696kennetha,something for everybody.,"The outfit serves great meal. The menu is diverse enough for choice. The ambience is great. It is great for family outing, socai or business meeting. If you are a non smoker, don't seat outside. Always ask to seat inside by the right.",50,Feb-17,4,Double Four VI
bhumie,Cool place for a drink,"I had a cocktail at double four. Nice drink, polite waitress, relaxing atmosphere but quite pricey. I preferred the outdoor seating.",40,Mar-16,4,Double Four VI
iyoboi,Not worth it,"So this was one of the most disappointing experiences of my Lagos restaurant week experience. I went to this restaurant with high hopes mostly due to nostalgia from its past glory days. 

I had the hummus with meat and kibble for my starter. This was...the best part of the meal for me although the hummus was a little too salty. For my main I had the chicken escalope with fries. I honestly gave up after 2 bites. It was tasteless and I was unimpressed by the presentation. It looked like a cheese pizza honestly. For dessert, they only had the Lebanese sweet when there's also ice cream on the menu. I honestly wish I could have eaten it and judged it appropriately but I just couldn't get used to the texture. It looked like yougurt and tasted like partially frozen sweetened custard. Wasn't really into it. I wish I had gone to Sakura instead as they share a kitchen. 

All I have to say is NEVER AGAIN. Just happy I got a voucher and didn't have to pay for the food. Speaking of the voucher, the hostess almost refused to accept it insisting that we pay cash even though we had a voucher. After a couple of minutes back and forth, she eventually let us go. I guess they weren't properly informed.

Honestly wasn't worth it.More",40,Nov-16,4,Double Four VI
