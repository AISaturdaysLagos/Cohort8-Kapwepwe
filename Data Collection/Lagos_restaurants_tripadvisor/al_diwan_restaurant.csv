gujjupanda,Scrumptious Food,"Al Diwan is our regular place to visit (say daily) hence I can give detailed experience about the same.

It is having amazing taste of Lebanese food from Humus, Kubus (Balloon Kubus), Shawarma, Roasted Chicken, Lamb and variety of appetizer. The staff is friendly and...chef is his best in service.

There are very less options in Vegetarian Meals however must visit place if you want to taste authentic Lebanese food.

One recommendation, smoking should not be allowed inside your restaurant. You have a separate restaurant outside, you can utilize that strictly for dinners with smoking and sometimes experienced a slow service.More",40,Sep-19,4,Al Diwan Restaurant
gcxotf,Unacceptable,"Had dinner last weekend with few friends.
The restaurant hardly busy (maybe two tables) service very poor very unprofessional regarding the ordering of the drinks and food.
It took an eternity for them to serve.
Quality of food much below Salma, 44 or Arabesque.
Price...not cheap.
Conclusion. Never ever againMore",45,Dec-18,4,Al Diwan Restaurant

PeterS13034,My favourite Lebanese restaurant in Lagos!,"I often wish we could split our reviews between the food and the service. I often feel it's wrong to punish the one because of the other.
Firstly, the food was really good. We were 3 people having dinner and ordered about 10 different small...plates to share. These included Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Fatoush Salad, Lamb Kabob and Kibbeh to name a few. They all tasted really fresh, flavorful and were beautifully presented in a variety of decorative dishes. The accompanying flat breads were warm, freshly made and just delicious. 
We started off with drinks in the outside area which was nice and cool after the rain and then went inside. I loved the decor and the atmosphere. As another reviewer wrote, you are almost transported to the Middle East, if you can ignore the Western Pop music playing ?
As for the service, the manager was really attentive and friendly but he can't be everywhere all the time.  Drinks were forgotten, and we had to wave at the servers when we wanted refills of to order something else. As there were only 3 other tables besides us, I feel that they need to be a bit more aware. ( I also hate having to wave my arms like a mad person in a restaurant)
Definitely not a cheap evening out at 69 000Nira for 3 people (about $200 at today's exchange) but that's food and drink included.More",10,May-17,4,Al Diwan Restaurant
StephPG,A true Middle-Eastern experience in the heart of Africa,"This is in the heart of Victoria Island area, and has probably the best special hummus I have tasted. The ambience is the best in Nigeria and even my Lebanese colleague commended the authenticity of the cuisine. If you are in Lagos, and in the...mood for Lebanese food, then Al Diwan is the place!More",50,May-16,4,Al Diwan Restaurant
hawk182016,A lagos DO NOT MISS eatery,"I've been to Al Diwan twice now and I'm sure I""ll be back. The staff is extremely welcoming and nice, you can book for big parties (we were 15 last time I went) and they'll do a special menu/price for you. They have a good...list of wine and drinks but we've also been able to bring our own bottles of wine for our big event.
Now, let's talk about the food: ssssoooooo delicious! The variety of dishes and how good and fresh they are, blew my mind. Humus, babaganoush, tabouli, and that's only to talk about the appetizers! Of course I haven't tried everything but I've asked for a copy of their menu so that I can pass an order and sometimes bring a couple of those dishes at home for the family! 
And if you feel like it they have a game corner with some backgammon and you can even have a shisha!
I highly recommend this restaurant if you feel like adding a little bit of variety to your everyday routine!More",50,May-16,4,Al Diwan Restaurant
CSRam,Al diwan Labenese Restaurant,"Its hard to believe this place is not packed with people every time I eat here.  The food is very fresh, delicious, and the service is ""lagos great"".  Anyone who dines in Lagos knows service can be frustrating due to language and cultural differences.  You...can order 4-8 items for 2 people, enjoy it and take the rest home.  The prices are commensurate with the portions.  The ambience is nice and soothing feeling like you've stumbled into an old, brick interior business off the streets of a local suq.  They've decorated with interesting, historical art, camel bags, rugs, ancient lighting fixtures and at some point, they will turn on a mix of old and new music with arabic undertones.  This will be a weekly regular for our expat assignment while in Lagos.More",40,Feb-15,4,Al Diwan Restaurant
KaiUWulff,Fusion can be good .. Here it is not ...,"You can take this as a private restaurant as you will get a seat anytime you go and also you can choose a good seat, the food and service both are good, they have good selection of food and drinks. They have very nice ambience...too.More",40,Apr-15,4,Al Diwan Restaurant

djpri,Hearty Lebanese Savoir-faire!,"I was looking for a good Lebanese restaurant with a clean interior and fantastic food for my Turkish friends. I was not disappointed at all. The surprise is that it took me so long to know this restaurant.
The staff were very welcoming. Food was...brilliant and decor was great. Price is better than what obtains in the other ones I have visited on the island. I will definitely be back here sooner than later.More",50,Aug-14,4,Al Diwan Restaurant
snowytrigger,Nicest Lebanese food around,"It starts with the decor. The moment you step through the door, you are transported instantly into the warm comfortable ambiance of the middle east - the colours are soothing without being dull, the music floats well enough to be heard but not distracting, and...the aroma of the delectable shistahouk or falafel just pulls you in. It has been over the years, a place of beautiful confluence and it remains as such. My only pet peeve with them is that they have not changed their uniform to be more arabic all these years. There is nothing else to find fault with. For lamb eaters, try the special hummus. A place to be in Lagos.More",40,Apr-14,4,Al Diwan Restaurant
asianink,you would think you are somewhere in the middle east,"Quite nice interior, pleasant staff and food fine. Not packed full of flavour but some attempts at authentic dishes such as makanek and chicken livers were not bad.  Portions small but prices fair. Will go again but longing for a step up in Lebanese cuisine...in lagos.More",40,Jan-14,4,Al Diwan Restaurant
