mrs_un0,Amazing dinner and drinks with family at Slow!,"Amazing time at Slow with my family. Went for post shopping drinks and then returned for dinner. They were so accommodating of my son's unique dietary needs and went above and beyond to ensure he had a great meal. 

The bar offers lovely handcrafted cocktails...with the freshest ingredients and they are happy to go off the menu when asked (hint - ask for a Porn Star Martini and you won't be disappointed)More",50,Jun-23,4,Slow

FolaOnTheGo,A Night to Remember and a Place to Return,"My first visit was for a birthday celebration, the atmosphere was great and the vibe very good. 2 sets of dining areas - one normal seating and the other high tops. The food was very good - the tacos are the beessstt !!! Wonderful evening...and the food and the vibe brought it all together .I wondered why i had not been there before.

Wanted to spoil an older good friend on her birthday and  wondered where i would take her that she had not been and would be impressed. Kept on crossing a number of places off in my head. Then i asked myself, where have you been recently that the food was very good and the vibe  w as lit? the answer was SLOW and it did not disappoint - food still very good - assortment of cocktails not the common type - tacos still delicious, kale salad amazing ! It made the right mark with my Egbon. The service was attentive and the waiter knew his onions, the ambience works - would be returningMore",45,Feb-23,4,Slow
MochaJean,Lovely dinner experience,"The atmosphere at Slow is unmatched. The foliage and decor provide an upscale tropical ambiance. The live jazz band played a few songs, which added to the specialness. 

All the food was delicious, starting with the octopus and house salad. For the main dishes, we...got the short ribs and the lamb shanks, which were also fabulous. If you want the bread pudding for dessert be aware that that takes an extra 25 minutes, so put the order in early. We opted for the cheesecake instead, which we did not regret. It was so smooth and creamy. 

I would highly recommend Slow for a romantic dinner or special occasion!More",40,Nov-22,4,Slow

SamKing M,An experience you will remember for a lifetime,"SLOW - This restaurant gives you a great feeling before you even walk in. The walkway to the front door makes one feel like we’re in a natural environment with plants and trees. 

Were met by highly competent and forthcoming personnel when we entered who...seated us at our table. Inside beautiful interior décor with a great rustic feel to the place. The place is separated into sections with plants which gives a great feeling of privacy as well as keeping to a natural beauty effect. The tables have small arrangements and comfortable dining chairs and there is even a window looking into the kitchen. If you’re not keeping up to perfection on hygiene levels, you would not advertise your kitchen. A fresh atmosphere with many interesting design sidekicks gives one a feeling of laid back and comfortable.

The waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the different courses on the menu, and the drinks. 
The waiter was always right on time pouring either water or wine when needed a refill.

The food was really nothing short of gourmet, and portions size, whilst they looked small at first, they had the perfect size to make us feel well fed. The plates were arranged beautifully, and the vibrant colours of the different dishes that were served looked almost like art.

We ordered Scallops, Eggs Benedict, seafood tacos, lamb chops, Oysters, and a few more.

You cant leave without trying the fresh bloody mary. it is to die for. 

This is a restaurant where you will have a perfect lunch/dinner for every special occasion.

The quality of the ingredients combined fully with impressive creativity from the chef’s team resulted in a series of positive surprises for us all. Many restaurants have menus that have over 100 dishes on them, but I prefer a more limited, clean-to-the-point menu that allows the chef to focus on making the limited dishes the best. 

SLOW rates very high on my restaurant lists in Lagos. My friends & I have eaten there many times and I have always been so pleased with the food, service, and ambiance. The food is exquisite, the service is great and timely and consequently, the pricing is on the high side, but it is well worth it. 

TIP – Sunday brunch is perfect as they have a live band.
Tip – Try the Oysters, it’s amazing but always reserve it in advanceMore",20,Jun-22,4,Slow
onoriodelucya,Take-out error,My first experience was disappointing as there was an omission in my order. The corn salad I ordered was supposed to have avocado in it but it came without avocado and it was rather pricey.,40,Sep-22,4,Slow
imsam,SLoW cooked to prefection,"This was our second visit to SLoW. The afternoon went very slow as we were enjoying every bit of the time spent there. The staff were courteous, well groomed and well trained.
The food is excellant and the chef takes extra time preparing it. The...tastes are unique. Even though the menu is not elaborate the spread is very good and makes you feel order all on the list.More",50,Jul-22,4,Slow
imsam,Quaint little place in heart of Lagos.,"Really a good place to eat lunch or Dinner.
Good place to take your business associates or customers for a formal lunch.
The service is really good and all the staff is attentive.
Food is ""SLOW"" cooked to perfection and taste is also good. Most...of the cuisine is south American. They can add more slow cooked food around the world to take a notch higher.
Ambience is good a a open plan sitting.More",50,Feb-22,4,Slow

Green S,never disappoints!,"Just wanted to thank you for the amazing experience every time we visit SLoW!  It is the one restaurant in Lagos that I can always depend on to deliver consistent, top quality food and service.  I know, without a doubt, that when we want to...impress, or treat someone, SLoW will always perform! Particularly like the charred pepper starters and flat bread. The kale-quinoa salad is outstanding!  My husband loves the steak and your  mash potatoes.More",50,Oct-21,4,Slow
gcxotf,Happening,"At the moment it's the place to be , see & being seen. ambience is top, staff professional, run by the same owners of RSVP.

407joano,SLOW but Terriffic Food,"Nice Banter, lovely atmosphere, some live music  all made it amazing.  Would have been great if the menu was contactless. in 2021, this is a must. We had to ask for 
 initial bread, and we got some amazing pizza bread. Drinks took a while to...come, Food took even longer, so true to their name of SLOW, and the restaurant wasn't even full for a Sunday early evening.  However, the food was heavenly once it did arrive. Pricey if you ask me, but i will return for sureMore",20,Aug-21,4,Slow
