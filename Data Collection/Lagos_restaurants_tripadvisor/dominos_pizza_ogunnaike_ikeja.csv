ayosuper,Good Snacking,"Good place to chill and have a discussion. I love the fact that every order was freshly prepared,waiting time was moderate.

Sammylex,Decent Place to stop by....but nothing special,"I visited this place with a friend (who practically dragged me), to have some ice-cream. It would be my first time at a coldstone creamery (because I am not a fan of ice cream). With the hype and all, I think the ice-cream tasted like...any other one and it's too expensive :-\.More",30,June 2019,4.0
K13_FAD,Ice cream crave,"For some reason or the other, cold stone isn’t on trip advisor☹️. Didn’t actually have pizza!!! Went in for ice cream and I wasn’t disappointment but for the somewhat stale nuts (had cashew and almond with my ice cream). Sadly, I went back for some...selection a few days after so probably wasn’t as bad as I originally felt it was. Good selection of flavours. Staff were friendly and extremely professional. One to take my kids to when we visit Nigeria.More",40,November 2018,4.0

AdioB,Pizza and Ice cream the Domino's way,"Great pizza and ice cream. Would recommend the chicken kickers with cheese bread, Delicious. Parking is a bit of a challenge, but there are ways around it. Ordering ice cream takes some time, because of the customization, so be patient. Only downside to this, is...that the waiting line, builds up and looks disorderly.More",50,September 2016,4.0
ANTHEASMITH,Home delivery,"This place not only makes the best pizza, they deliver to your home within a 30 minute time period and the pizza's are piping hot and delicious. Placing the order over the phone the staff are very helpful and will offer extra specials and items...not on the menu. It was easy to order, fantastic delivery timing and delicious pizza.

JAT C,Spot on................................................,These pizzas are authentic and scrumptious. The medium meatzza(hope that's spelt right. lol) is more than enough for two people with a pocket friendly price to match. This is our 4th time eating here and it hits the spot every time. The staff are friendly...and informed and make an effort. Really like this place.More,40,March 2015,4.0
