SamKing M,RSVP - A new style and approach to fine dining,"Whilst I‚Äôm not one to really complain and prefer to appreciate when things are amazing, id like to be informed on a place and always do the same.

SEATING

The new RSVP finally opens after months with glam and elegance to its new look. Some...say the booth system is old and outdated but really RSVP brings it all back to the modern look giving the client the feeling of privacy and allowing one to enjoy an intimate meal. Walking in you can tell you are in a fine dining restaurant. I give it a 9 on 10

But is it only about the look? let's rate the rest.

SERVICE:
We were welcomed in and the manager got us seated immediately. The waiters were on point to bring us the menu and give us a few minutes to look through it. The waiters however do stand right over you. Hard to enjoy a meal with them 1 Meter in front of u. I know they need to be in sight and with the booth system,  it‚Äôs hard to get the attention but I‚Äôd suggest they walk around every few mins as opposed to standing over the guest.

The staff constantly asks you for a happy weekend. this means they want a tip. Yes, this is very normal in Nigeria but in a fine dining place like RSVP, one would hope this doesn‚Äôt happen. It certainly does not happen at the fine dining restaurant (SLOW) owned by the same chain.

Let's rate this with a 6 on 10.

FOOD:

The tacos were nice and crunchy. The perfect sweet and salty blend to give a mouthwatering experience to the taste. 

The beef carpaccio which is actually Beef Tatar was nice but very salty. Perhaps this was just a one-off. Beef Tatar is one of my favorite dishes so my expectations were perhaps too high. 

The lobster sushi seemed dry but the taste-wise was great.  It does happen and we have experienced this before in other restaurants. perhaps it is the humidity. 

Some think it's easy to make a french fry and all one needs to do is deep fry chips but really there is a whole way of making the perfect chip and RSVP pulled it off fabulously.

We ordered the pot stickers which tasted amazing but I wish they looked as good as they taste,

For food let's rate this a 7 on 10.

DRINKS:

We ordered 2 Bloody Mary‚Äôs and the waiter was quite clear that it would take time to make and this was well appreciated. It did taste amazing and I love how RSVP uses fresh tomatoes to make this instead of a packet.

lats rate this a 9 on 10.

Overall experience was pleasant. I would most definitely visit this place again. I look forward to trying the Oysters next.

fitzmigman,Interesting,"The lamb shank at R.S.V.P was simply amazing. It was fall-off-the bone yummy.  The lamb shank was one of the best that I have had anywhere in the world. Even better than the lamb shank was the attention to customer service provided by the manager...on duty Halim, He was a major difference maker. We arrived at the restaurant without having reservations, which is a no-no (duh..RSVP). Halim welcomed us and, after a short wait, provided a table. While waiting, I had an amazing drink at the bar. The ""porn star martini"". I highly recommend it!
