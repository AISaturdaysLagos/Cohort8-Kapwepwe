ooobabatunde,Excellent.,"It has been over 5 years since I was last here, I was quite impressed that quality has not slipped. Food was excellent,  wine was very good. Definitely one of the hidden gems in Lagos. Will definitely recommend and visit again! 

Well done!",40,March 2023,4.0
Dee21much,Five Star Restaurant,A great experience. The service was top notch. Would recommend this place for anyone visiting Lagos.,45,November 2021,4.0
olufuntof,Just an okay place,"Maybe this place used to be tops. I didn’t get that vibe upon visiting this restaurant. First off, the lack of a signboard to properly locate this place was non existent.. secondly, except if traditional was a vibe they are going for? It’s not westernized...enough. It reminds me of the good old days. The food is alright but could be better. Especially for the price charged.More",45,August 2021,4.0
Namdi1982,Very Private - even when full.,"This is ""the"" spot for date night or a business meeting. No kids allowed, no shorts, not unnecessarily noisy. Very straightforward. 

When we came in there was only one other table seated. Soon after we got our drinks other tables got occupied and it was...a full house or close to. Still, the place felt very private. Tables are spaced out appropriately and there are a lot of corner tables to choose from.

Food - amazing. 
Service - surprisingly really good and well coordinated. 
Venue - private, modern, minimalistic. Shame there isn't an outdoor.

 My new spot in Lagos.More",40,January 2021,4.0
AdioB,Lovely Place,"This restaurant is located on a one way street with inside and outside parking. The entrance looks unassuming until you step into an enclave of white and ebony colours, silverware and furniture. The food is a specially crafted for elegance. Lovely place for dates. The...waiters are neat, articulate, observant  and take their jobs very seriously. They are good at recommending dishes and seem to take pride in making sure you have a good experience.More",35,December 2019,4.0

Liglossmaffia,Amazing mixed grill!,"I brought my mum here to celebrate her birthday. The prices threw her off so I suggested the mixed grill. It came with three sides. They were so properly spiced. The steak was well cooked, the chicken was divine. The calamari was fantastic! I had...the popular Henessy cocktail and I didn't like it. I guess I have a sweet tooth. Highly recommended especially for dates.More",50,June 2019,4.0
Wole O,Talindo steak,"I had heard about this place before we went. So when it was suggested, I said okay, let's see. We were the only ones when we got in, but by midway it was different. Food came promptly and everything seemed nice, only very ordinary. The...staff were very courteous and well trained, they could have been robots. Talindo seems a popular place in Lagos, but for me, too staid, space too small and the fare too plain. It's an accountants dream. Too dull.More",20,January 2019,4.0
johne999a,Big key down,"I was asked to recommend a place for my boss for a company dinner, we have eaten in many places in Lagos but not here. 

Finding it was fun, no sign outside, no one in the street knew, arrived, Tuesday with reservation, need not have...worried only two other tables occupied.

Service was slow, each request required consultation, finally placed our orders. I always worry when a so-called fine dining restaurant provides only cheap paper tissues, even more remarkable, they brought a holder with just three for three people. 

We avoided steaks so as not to be too disappointed, my boss and partner had fish, which was pretty OK. I had a shrimp concoction, which was just shrimp and tomato sauce. Tasty but simple especially as it was more than $25.

The wine list is very limited, especially whites, so really don’t go expecting an amazing culinary experience.More",50,November 2018,4.0
T-Africa2000,No international credit cards,Talindo is an old favourite in Lagos and they have certainly kept the quality of the food up. I had a steak with prawns and it was really good. Our waiter tried very hard but was a little unsure of himself. The downstairs section is...being refurbished so we were on the second floor which wasn't as cozy. At the end of the meal I wanted to pay with my international visa card and we were informed that they currently only accept local credit cards. They really should have let us know earlier. I didn't have enough cash on hand and my Nigerian colleague had to pick up the tab. Not great.More,40,September 2018,4.0

Francis N,"Excellent meal, excellent place, excellent service","I took my significant other here to celebrate his birthday. We're huge meat lovers so our expectations were very high. We went on a Saturday afternoon and the place was basically empty which we didn't mind. Service was great; waiter was very attentive. Our starters...were a bit underwhelming. For starters, we had feta rolls and calamari. The calamari had more veg than actual calamari and the dip for the feta rolls was way too spicy for the type of rolls served. We had our steaks medium rare and they were quite tasty although a bit too bloody and chewy for my liking in some parts. The mash was nice and very creamy. The fries had a weird taste as though it had been in the freezer for too long. It was definitely an above average meal and I left there feeling well fed but for the prices, I expected perfection. I was in a good mood that day as we were celebrating so I didn't bother kicking up a fuss. I'd go back and maybe try the pork.More",40,August 2017,4.0
missdeola,Food so good you forget how expensive it is.,"Had a business dinner for about 10 people and never knew a place so nice was quietly tucked in a corner in Victoria Island. The place has no signage but was invited by friends. The meal was excellent, the service excellent too, the ambience was...cozy and very nice. I actually took my family for Sunday lunch soon after and they had a brilliant time. I recommend the desert of hot chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream served steaming- melts in your mouth.More",30,July 2017,4.0
0_Lumi_A,Good Food - Pricey - Small Portions,"I had the best salad at Talindo's. Great service. Friendly staff. The soft music and lights set the perfect mood. Ideal for couples and lovers of steak, just be prepared to wait a little longer if you order any of the beef meals.",30,April 2018,4.0
Olumide K,A must visit,"The food here is good but expensive!
Ambience is ok. Staff can do with better training.
