T-Africa2000,Much improved,"We had a business dinner at 1415 this week and we were very impressed with the service levels and even more with the quality of the food. The Nederburg red by the glass was delicious and perfectly cooled. They served us a complimentary asparagus soup...entrée which was amazing. We then ordered the jumbo prawns and the lamb chops, both outstanding and beautifully presented. The sauces were delicious and the sides were excellent. It’s a pity the restaurant is inside the hotel and doesn’t have an amazing atmosphere because the food is certainly up to it.More",40,Jan-20,4,1415 Steakhouse Seafood Restaurant
sunilt1960,Calm and Relaxing,"Had dinner at this restaurant while staying in Eko hotel on a business trip. A very relaxing place with a very good ambience and excellent décor secluded from the busy areas of the hotel complex. Didn't find many people when I visited, but enjoyed the...live music.  Sea food was excellent and served in style along with the soup. However slightly pricey. Service was good and the waiters were very friendly. They can improve on the drinks and needs to update the menu. Hopes to go there again to try more of the menu, next time when I stay at Eko hotel.More",45,Feb-19,4,1415 Steakhouse Seafood Restaurant

MrTraveller420,1415 Steakhouse,"Went over to the old location of the Steakhouse and was told they've now been moved to 1415. 
They did not disappoint. The combo as a seafood Steakhouse is excellent.  My salmon tartar was perfect, my beef tenderloin was impressive and overall this was one...of my finer meals in Lagos. The service was superb. I was very impressed.  We even got to thank the chef at the end our meal. 

Well done guys.More",40,Nov-18,4,1415 Steakhouse Seafood Restaurant

lapeml,Great service,"The service was a bit iffy and all the staff wanted to do was prepare the restaurant for breakfast so the were hurrying the few patrons they had. The meal itself was pretty good, with Italian cold cuts to start and we both had chicken...main courses.

Andrew P,Big Birthday Bash,"Visited on a Sunday with my family. I should have taken the emptiness of the restaurant as a sign but still we proceeded thinking perhaps we will get even better service and yummy Italian food. 

I had been looking forward to trying it as it...is in a very popular hotel and that comes with hotel prices so I decided to go with family and let them pay! Haha. I had minestrone soup for starters and lasagne for my main (I had been looking forward to a scrumptious meal). We pretty much had hot tasteless water as minestrone (super disappointed) and I had a burnt slice of lasagne which was tasty but it had burnt edges like it has been left a bit too long in a microwave. The food took a while to come out from the kitchen and we wondered why as we were the only 3 in the restaurant. Smh. It was NOT worth the money or the time. 

Perhaps other people have had better luck or we went on an ""off"" day, ah well..... Never again. Moving on.

P.S. the 2 star rating is for the decor! I loved the light fixtures!More",50,Sep-17,4,1415 Steakhouse Seafood Restaurant
