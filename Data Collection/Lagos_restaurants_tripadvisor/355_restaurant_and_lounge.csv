Y6571FYandyc,A Huge Disappointment,"I visited at around 9pm on a Tuesday. The first challenge is to negotiate a worryingly steep staircase of thin stairs once thus has been achieved you find yourself in a well appointed, spacious, nicely decorated lounge. Like every other restaurant / bar / lounge...in Lagos I was also greeted with music being played at an unnecessarily loud volume. To avoid this, I noticed a side lounge where the impact of the music was lessened. This space is especially good for people who suffer from light sensitivity issues as you sit on a virtual darkness. I was given a menu and trying to read the small print in the dark proved a fruitless exercise so I downloaded the menu on my phone and ordered a sangria and a chicken burrito. The sangria was not a sangria but a sangria posing as a frozen margarita. I have had sangria in three countries and have never before had a mountain of ice in my glass. The impact of this was twofold - firstly, true to Archimedes Principle, the weight of the ice has the impact of raising the level of the sangria to the rim of the glass which makes negotiating it in the dark a wet, sticky experience and secondly dealing with the first problem by sucking through a straw delivers 'brain freezer. Luckily, the darkness spared the other diners from witnessing my head holding pain!!

The food arrived and looked OK. I moved to a higher table to reduce the distance from plate to mouth (given the attendant perils of dining in the dark). As for the food, the chicken burrito tasted like it should, the refried beans tasted like they should and the rice tasted like it should. It would have been very good but for one thing. There was not a single hot (or even warm thing) on my plate. At this point I decided to eat it as presented, pay the bill and go. I'm sad to say it was a nightmare in the dark. However I'm nothing if not balanced so it's only fair to point out that the service was responsive, helpful and unobtrusive and the setting is very nice. I suspect it gets livelier and noisier later on. Buy the bottom line is that I wanted a quiet, tasty hot meal in a nice setting. What I got was a disappointingly cold meal in a slightly noisy setting that I couldn't see in a lounge I chose to escape the louder music. Could have been very good. It wasn't!!More",45,July 2021,4.5
Tia011,I cannot believe they get away with this,"I am livid as i write, I generally don’t give up on a restaurant after 1 bad experience but this place was just disgusting. We ordered a takeaway. 

I ordered the signature wings and seafood platter. 
I cannot describe the nasty refried rubbish with bits...missing we were presented with. The food looked like frozen food deep fried, i tasted one mouthful then had to bin it and make alternative arrangements for our food.

The real insult is that a platter implies an assortment of items described in the menu. Ladies and gentlemen- look at the picture and see the rubbish we were served in a standard sized plastic container. Notice no sole no spring rolls and the rubbery disgusting food costs N19,600 for this rubbish. There were two jumbo prawns and stodgy mass produced calamari and sticky clumps of pastry. The prawn was like rubber covered in sellotape doused in salt. I have never tasted such awfulness in my life.

I can’t comprehend the good reviews, we eat out very often but this amongst  the worst food we’ve ever been presented with. It was badly described, poorly cooked and shoddily presented. 

There is no justification for this, they had no signature wings. Their response when I complained was could they bring it to me tomorrow!!! Totally clueless and inept customer service. It seems to me that  are taking advantage of their position in VI to serve unimaginative, tasteless food. Yucky on every level! No self respecting establishment would allow food of this quality to go out to a customer.More",20,April 2020,4.5

Olakunle B,Exquisite,There haven’t been many restaurants in Lagos that have run consistently like 355 restaurant and lounge. The quality of food compliments the ambience and service. Great place!,50,January 2019,4.5
Temitope A,Food and relaxation,"Because I work not to far from the restaurants location, it's always a first choice for my colleagues and I when we want quality food and a great atmosphere. 355 never fails to deliver. I've been to their spot at Marina in Lagos island and...I got the same level of satisfactionMore",50,November 2018,4.5
_kaiserrey,Delicious food!,"Visited with a large group of friends. The ambience is very nice. The stairs are a bit worrisome though in terms of their steepness (especially for women if you're wearing heels) but I really enjoyed the food! So did the group! I had the seafood...pasta and it was the right amount of tasty & spicy. 

I would visit and order the same thing until the staff know that's all I eat lol. Only slight downsides were that the music was a bit loud but as we were all yapping away, it didn't detract from a lovely evening out with friends, and we only had 1 member of staff taking all our orders so that took some time but the service from the kitchen seemed quick enough.More",50,February 2018,4.5
Saminish,Hot spot for dinner and dancing,"The pasta was great and so are the drinks. This spot has a cool vibe, great music and the upstairs bar/club is awesome.",40,December 2017,4.5
lizzielicious,It's Alright,This place won't be my first choice for dinner and hang out but it's alright. Parking is always a nightmare like all places in VI. The food is alright- the Italian and Mexican dishes have somewhat of a Nigerian twist to them. Friday nights are...the best time to visit.More,50,November 2016,4.5
tolaa17,Tola,"Great food, perfect music and good cocktails. Margaritas are next to none in lagos. Try the Wahalarita MArgarita",30,February 2017,4.5
Chinma A,Attentive Staff,"Went out for a girl's night out here. The music was good, the food (esp the chicken breast and creamed spinach) was great with crispy chips! My favourite of their drinks was the Wahalarita...generally a bit pricey though. It was a bit hot inside so...we requested to be sat outside. There are no parking facilities available so it causes a bit of a bind.More",50,January 2017,4.5
Honourable Tola A,"Great space, music, food and drink. Perfect hang out spot","Dear Chinma A.
