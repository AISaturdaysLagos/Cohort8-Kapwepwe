Dher5,Best restaurant in Lagos!,"We absolutely loved Veggie Victory, and being vegetarian in Lagos, it is difficult to find good veggie food here! 

Veggie Victory is now at Dolphin Estate, give them a call when you get to the Estate to find the exact house (there isn't a sign)...- but don't worry, its a lovely sit down restaurant. 

For tourists, this place is a great spot to try many local Nigerian dishes, with specifically vegetarian/vegan options! We loved everything we ordered, the staff were lovely and the food came quickly. Prices are totally reasonable, if anything on the cheap side! Cannot recommend more highly!More",40,February 2020,4.0

0504Traveller,Great Veggie and Vegan Food in Lagos,"It is very hard to find vegetarian and vegan food in Nigeria so when I heard of the Veggie Victory, and I had heard they were serving vegan/vegetarian Nigerian food I immediately wanted to try it.

The restaurant is located in Freedom Park and is...in a line with other restaurants.  They share the seating in an open courtyard.  The food is really good, large portions with really good flavor and good tastes.  The price is also very good so overall great option in LagosMore",40,June 2018,4.0
