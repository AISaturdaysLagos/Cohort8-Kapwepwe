serenaa,Lovely ambience and attentive staff...the food is just ok,"I went as a treat for lunch on a weekend day with my sister who had raved about this being the best Chinese restaurant on the Island. We ordered spring rolls which was really nice and chicken wings in garlic and ginger which was a...bit to gingery and spicy for starters. For the main we ordered a rice dish with seafood which I found just so so. I had a cocktail called Chapman to drink which tasted not quite right...the staff were very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and gave us some tasters to help us make up our minds. In all, I was just a bit underawed. I won't go back in a hurry.More",30,Jul-14,3,Chinaville Chinese Restaurant
