robertgB5456BA,Lovely light cuisine,"Attended Sakura with friends and sampled a selection of sashimi, miso soup, some tempura prawns and seafood. Sat outside in comfortable surroundings. Service was good, food excellent. Chairs comfortable but a little low and too big to bring close to table, but this did not...detract for the evening spent with friends dining out in Lagos. Can be expensive if you do not watch what you are ordering. But for the 4 of us, 3 bottles of quite acceptable wine and medley of tastes it represented reasonable value for the evening. Traffic as always can be a nightmare so leave early to get there if aiming for about 7pm.More",40,September 2017,4.0
lizzielicious,Really good.,"I go here for Japanese cuisine and I love it. The sushi is always fresh and delicious and I love the noodle dishes. Service meets up to expectations. Will keep going back for my sushi fix. Haven't tried the Double 4 bit of the restaurant...and I find the mix of Italian and Japanese weird but hey, it's never stopped me from having good food and great fun.More",40,December 2016,4.0
chach87,Perfect,"The place is nice: you can sit outside and enjoy a good cocktail or eat inside and choose between Japanese, Thai or continental menus. The food and service are very good. Just a little bit expensive. To be tested.",40,December 2016,4.0
Meenahj10,Dinner for one,I love Sakura been there once before and it was amazing. This trip I went solo and it was ok not as good as the first time. The Japanese menu is fully Stocked with loads of amazing things. A little bit pricey but hey it's...Lagos everything is pricey!! Food was ok to be honest. The dynamite prawns were amazing the dumplings and scallops were not all that. However amazing service and wonderful ambiance great for a date and a quiet dinner during the week. They also had an interesting outside area that would be definitely worth visiting when it stops being so hot. All in all a good restaurantMore,35,November 2016,4.0
anshuvilla9,Japanese and double 44,Unique Japanese and Lebanese restaurant in heart of Victoria Island.  Nice outdoor and indoor dinning.  Good food and the Japanese teriyaki and sushi always love it.  Good that they have the Lebanese restaurant also as not all comfortable with just Japanese.  Love to eat outside....Food is really good.  Always choice is nice with Japanese as kids don't eat like Sushi.  Good selection of teriyaki dishes who like cooked food.  Spoil you self with delicious meza.More,40,October 2016,4.0
Renee P,"Good food, average service","Had the opportunity to have lunch at Sakura today.  I order steamed scrimp dumplings as a starter and Crazy Craze (Crab, Avo) salad as a main.  The salad was brought first - very tasty, but also very little on the crab and avocado in the...mostly cabbage and carrot salad.  The dumplings were brought before I had done with my salad - dumplings were good.More",40,August 2016,4.0
Piedrarip,Real taste of Japan,"This restaurant doubles with Lebanese restaurant 44, so you can decide what kind of kind of meal do you want. Sushi menu wasn't very clear to me so decided for one of their complete Japanese menu with miso soup, salad, main meal and tea. It...was tasty and filing.
Outside seating in their spacious outdoor garden is wonderful. Lebanese owner was around checking that customers get appropriate attention.
Japanese restaurant in Lagos means it's not cheap, but not too overpriced.
Would love to come back.More",50,July 2016,4.0
LindaHartley,Couples dinner,"Ended up here on Friday night after going to Izanagi down the road and finding they had such a lack of choice for sushi.

Freja A,Lovely garden,"We went there for lunch with young kids and it's perfect for them to play in the garden while waiting for the food. There's shade, trees and some lizards to chase. Food was ok, service good. The thick noodles were not Asian noodles but linguini....See weed salad was very nice.More",30,May 2016,4.0
Phyxssius,"Good ambience, OK food","Had a business meeting there and we ordered noodles, the turn around time for preparation was good, but the food was just OK, its something I can easily whip up on a Sunday afternoon and won't cost me 3,600. All in all its a nice...place but a bit pricey.More",40,April 2016,4.0
mayanne_young,Mixed feelings,"The decor was very Asian and tasteful. We ordered for gyoza and dynamite shrimp which was amazing. Our main dish was soba noodles and chicken teriyaki. The waitress got the order wrong and told the chef calamari teriyaki. My date had to crosscheck with her...and she argued it until the chef had already prepared it. She later came to tell us that she'd pack the calamari for us at no extra charge as she didn't want her boss to know of her error. During our meal which was amazing the lights went out, for close to 20 minutes, imagine the heat. After the meal she brought the bill, she'd assured that the calamari wasn't on the bill as it was no mistake of ours for me to look at the bill and see it. She took it back and the boss came up to me with an attitude saying that I'd ordered for the calamari what then was the problem. On clarification, she rectified it. To pay with my card, the waitress keyed in the wrong figure which would have been a major loss to them. I had to correct her error and do another transaction for her with the correct amount. 
The food was amazing but the whole dining experience was watered down for us. 
I don't think we'd be back anytime soon.More",50,March 2016,4.0

Jon W,"Great food, good choice","I have been to Sakura several times, and never been disappointed with the food. It's not cheap, but reasonable for the quality. Just a shame the wine is quite expensive.  
Extra bonus now, Restaurant 44 operates from the terrace, so you can also get what...looked like a good range of middle east BBQ food and Salads.More",40,January 2016,4.0
KROgirl,Fab food!,"The food at Sakura is so delicious. Similarly to other Lagos restaurants it's not cheap. But there is a really good range of Japanese food, all cooked to a high standard. Good service too!",40,November 2015,4.0
Renua,Truly Amazing Food,"I love Japanese food but I was skeptical about this....lets just say I wasn't disappointed...the staff were friendly, food was sooooo yummy and ambience was fantastic....I strongly recommend this restaurant...it's a hidden gem....my hubby isn't a fan of Japanese food but he loved every bite!!",40,September 2015,4.0

962gilliani,Very poor food,"Nice place, but food to a poor standard. No Chinese or Thai menu available, so Japanese only. The food was terrible, very expensive. When I order crab I expect crab, not sashimi which has never seen fish in its life. The set tapenyaki menu was...More",40,July 2015,4.0
