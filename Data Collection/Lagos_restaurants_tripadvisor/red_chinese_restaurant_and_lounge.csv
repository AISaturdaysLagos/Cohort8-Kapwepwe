Ade703,Not bad but I expected more,"Red restaurant is one of several restaurants within the Eko hotel complex, it's a Chinese restaurant located above the car park building. The ambience is nice, decor is modern and fits the Chinese theme, the staff are very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable when it comes...to the menu items; I have to give them high points for a bit disappointing as I expected it to taste much better than it did (it was pretty basic). The cocktails were good but not great. 

Overall it's a nice place but a bit of a let down.More",40,November 2020,4.0

sunilt1960,Good Chinese restaurant,"Red Chinese restaurant is one of the best restaurants in the the Eko hotel, It has nice Chinese decor and cosy setting with good view of the Atlantic ocean. It has also a well stocked bar. I have been to this restaurant twice, but always...was not busy and that is what I liked of the restaurant. The sea food which I ordered was served in authentic Chinese plates with cutlery as well as the sauces and candle light to match. The waiters were very friendly and willing to meet the requests.More",45,February 2019,4.0
Chris H,Tasty Chinese,"This is a well furnished and attractive restaurant and its beeeg. It has a separate bar area which is reasonably well stocked. Unfortunately due to its size the place appeared very empty and underwhelming as we visited on what I hope was a quiet night....The menu is comprehensive and all meals are well prepared. We all had the Chicken and corn soup as starters and it was an excellent beginning. Chicken with Cashew nuts, Spicy Duck and Beef all supported by a bowl of vegetable rice followed as main courses and we shared tastes from all. The portions are huge and we could have cut one of the main courses. Service was prompt and friendly. Not a cheap meal but great for a special nightMore",40,May 2019,4.0
susanne o,Birthday Dinner was fantastic,"Ok so I had my birthday dinner at RED , first of all the ambiance is everything üòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Red is officially one of my favorite restaurants to be honest!! It was alsooooo very affordable for a Chinese restaurant in VI!! I loved it!!",30,April 2019,4.0
ayodejiogunnusi,Red is not what it used to be,"Decided to visit Red Chinese for my cheat meal & i must say I was not all too pleased. The restaurant itself is actually quite pretty and clean but the food & cocktail was a bit bleh. There was quite a range of food options...of which we tried quite a few. What tasted good - chicken & sweet corn soup, salt & pepper ribs & fried wonton. Aside from that, we tried spicy fish, beef in black bean, seafood fried rice, Singapore noodles, crab cakes; the food was all a bit too oily and quite bland. I'd have to say Red needs a new chef. The wait staff were quite nice and were willing to help when we complained about the food being cold, our prawn mayonnaise roll having no mayonnaise, my amareto sour tasting like medicine etc. Don't think I'd be going back anytime soon to be honestMore",40,February 2019,4.0
Renua,New Year Flop,"Red was doing a buffet on news years day. Having been a few years ago for my birthday. I decided it was a great idea to take my husband and 3 children. 

We sat and ordered drinks. Then I got up to sort out food...for the family.  Rice had only 2 options. Steamed white rice and seafood rice. But the seafood rice was finished! Wow! The Singapore noodles was only enough for one child ...I complained at this point and they promised to make more just for us....

The sauses were either none existent, dried out, finished or cold!! I considered walking out but my children were starving, plain white was better than no food. 

I was hoping desert was better but goodness me what a flop

My last thought was....You can‚Äôt possibly go wrong with the drinks at least right? I ordered a Singapore sling which tasted like colored Cough syrup. Disgusting. 

This is NOT Eko Hotel Standard and I will not be returning. 

There are so many options in Lagos....there was a reason this restaurant was empty...!More",50,January 2019,4.0
AnotherBizTraveler,One of the best!,"It's not easy to find a good restaurant in Lagos, strange especially if you think of the size of the city.  Well, RED is one of the best.  A great long bar counter, great drinks, a really good food and a very professional service make...us a great dinner experience.  Definitely a safe choice when in Lagos...More",40,November 2018,4.0

Madgie M,"Dear Red,sort out a few things and you'll be 5*.","I booked a table for 9 for my evening birthday dinner.Upon arrival,I apologised for being an hour late and they were very understanding.I soon realised why...at 8:30 pm on a Saturday night the place was practically empty! A family were leaving as we were arriving.I...didn't take this as a poor reflection on them, we are all feeling the economic pinch right now. So,we placed our orders with a VERY attentive and pleasant waiter, he really excelled himself. However,he had no choice but to inform us that prawns (unless premade like in a dumpling etc) and duck were unavailable.
Que??? In a Chinese restaurant?? So that was a downer because I had been craving prawns and broccoli!
The next disappointment was my non-alcoholic cocktail.
I can't recall the name ( smooth lady?? something smooth, I dunno). It looked and tasted like Pepto Bismol!! 
I ""parked"" the vile pink concoction and ordered a Chapman. It was good. you really can't go wrong with Naija's signature tipple!
When the food came, it was verrrrry good. The calamari with salt and pepper was heavenly, as were the chicken wings. The fried rice was amazing, light and non-greasy.The dim sum ( prawn dumplings and wonton) were tasty but miniscule in size. I tried a few mains but I got fed up of spinning that table rotation thingy, it squeaked so loudly, needed some lubricant or something.We were too stuffed for dessert, but we looked at the menu hoping to be tempted. We were informed only fruit salad and ice cream were available. Ugh!
In summary, if they sort out their lack of popular items like prawn and duck,get rid of the squeaky table,make better non-alcoholic cocktails,have dessert readily available,then this restaurant will be perfect! The decor is nice, staff are wonderful, and we actually,all in all had a good time.I would definitely go again, despite the 3* rating which I had to give because the flaws were too significant.More",30,April 2018,4.0
Viveeee,ALWAYS A NICE EXPERIENCE,"This restaurant is a nice place for family and friends for lunch or dinner, it's also a good place for business meeting/visits. its cozy and if you love Chinese food then you are likely to love Red.
The ambience really nice and the view is...one of the best in Eko hotel. Great service and very courteous staff. 
The only but is I think it a bit pricey as the quality of food is same as any other Chinese restaurant.More",10,February 2018,4.0
Ade2566,Can't Go Wrong Here for Asian Cuisine,"Simple evening out with friends following a meeting in the Eko Hotel that hosts the Red Restaurant.  I had basic fried rice with tofu and vegetables which came out better than expected. Rice was fried but you could'nt tell as it was not oily. Tofu...and vegetables in sauce was well prepared with a good balance of spices that did not overpower the tofu nor vegetables...simply allowing my taste buds to experience the different spices and accompanying flavors.  Wines are moderate to expensive in price and with good range and vintage. Staff are friendly and knowledegable about the food.
Ambiance is really nice and comforting. They have a bar that looks well stocked as well.  Overall good value for money.More",50,December 2017,4.0
ZeeGoes,Needs a new chef,The entire menu needs work. The food tastes nothing like Chinese food or the modernixed version of chinese food. Visited a few times with family and friends and the food simply does not add up in its flavor profile.,50,November 2017,4.0

TaofickO,"Not ""Red"" with envy","I was at the launch of Red restaurant and lounge a last year. It was attended by high quality people from different backgrounds and nationalities. 
The finger food served was very good, cocktails was good and I was quite impressed. 
I was there of recent...for lunch with a group of 8, food was served promptly but was not that great. It was regular Chinese that could have been from a less prestigious restaurant without the price tag. It could be due to the fact that it was early afternoon and possibly the main chef not around, which really is no concern of mine as this didn't reflect on our bill. Whatever the time or situation the standard should be upheld. 
I will try it again, possibly in the evening when it's in its full element and observe if the meals are better.
Service was good, great view, and appeared well maintained.More",40,July 2017,4.0
