Ade703,Great place (note: this is a review of the Cubana Hut & Grill in Ikeja GRA),"Cubana Hut & Grill is a nice new place located in Ikeja G.R.A. It's almost an exact replica of the Cubana in Victoria Island but in my view, this one has a more contemporary feel and look to it. There's a large outdoor sitting area...for those who prefer to eat outdoors (this has a garden-like feel); right next to the outdoor area is a small indoor sitting area (downstairs) for those who might prefer something a bit less rowdy. Lastly there's yet another restaurant (Rhapsody's) indoors and upstairs. This has a clean, upscale feel with different sitting sections, ideal for both small and large groups of diners. The food tasted great, though slightly pricey. The cocktails were great as well and at a much better price point. There's ample parking space outside as well. 

Overall I'd definitely recommend this place and will likely visit again.More",45,February 2020,4.5

Safariafficionado,Great dinner with friends on my first day,"MY friends invited me out for dinner, but as traffic was too thick we decided to walk and then ended up at the Cubana. We ordered mud fish and none of us was disappointed with the quantity and the quality. Unique experience!",50,November 2019,4.5
vanBoheemen,Good grill restaurant,Very nice dinner with a delicious fish from the grill spiced with local spices and a beautiful taste. Good cold beers to go with that,40,September 2019,4.5
BOO259,Crowd Puller!,I was here for a business meeting. The environment is natural with a lot of courteous staff. The menu on offer is freshly made and that made it very appetising. Just make sure you are not too hungry going there as you get your order...roughly 45 minutes because of the preparation. Highly recommended.More,50,April 2019,4.5
hawksparrow,Very matured and exquisit,"Was here in company of friends and was first touched by the out-door setting in a unique and casual way. A life band was setting up and other customers were seated in relaxed formats.
Great ambience and well-behaved staff. drinks were cold and brought on...promptly.
My highlight was the grilled cat fish: waooo!! I strongly recommend the fish.
Band came on and played the most soft and clear rendition of popular blues and Nigerian artists.
Early rain drove the crowd under cover and disrupted the band, but the fun went home with me.
I will certainly go here again with my family.More",40,March 2019,4.5

aadedayo,Great spot,"I just want to talk about the Grilled Cat Fish. I had been craving it for a while. Having stuck to a particular spot for cat fish, a friend recommended Cubana. I am never going anywhere else again. My goodness. The fish was juicy and...tasty, spiced just right for me. I finished it all by myself. Customer service was great. I think I have found my home for fish in Lagos.More",40,August 2018,4.5
247Alexana,Spice and brew!!,"I stumbled upon this location when I was in Lagos...was stuck in traffic and just needed somewhere to sit and wait it out and walked into this location, am I glad I did! I have never thanked God for traffic before but this place got...me doing that!!
I asked the hostess what she would recommend and she said that she loved the Fish...I ordered the roasted fish in a foil and some dun-dun(deep fried-yam) and a bottle of very cold Stout!!(I am salivating even as I write this). It was so good and spicy! I would highly recommend both this place and the dish for who ever chances upon this place...More",50,April 2018,4.5
Dupri00,Nice Hangout and Ambience,"Cubana Lagos is the new addition to the Cubana family following from the bar and nite club in Abuja.

It is very spacious with lots of meal options including the legendary point and kill cat fish. There is also roasted chicken traditional Nigerian and contemporary...meals. The menu is quite impressive.

The premise also houses a nite club called the Grind. I didn't however have the opportunity to go there.

I however have a few concerns as most of the parking spaces within the premises are reserved for valet parking so you probably have to park along the road.

Service was also not top notch as you will expect with most bars in Lagos on the island. Lastly the drinks weren't cold. Got warm after a few minutes of exposure. They certainly need to work on this if you are paying above average prices for drinks.

Overall it is an okay joint for couples and large groups.More",40,February 2018,4.5
