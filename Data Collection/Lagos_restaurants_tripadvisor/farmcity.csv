Inspire39354053248,Horrible Delivery Service,Horrible delivery service. They always promise a 1 hour delivery but takes 2-3 hours. My last order officially took 3 hours to be delivered.,30,Apr-23,3,Farmcity

_Temtopelawal,Rude customer care agent,"Your whatsapp customer care lady that attended to me now 6pm/9.May2022 is extremely rude. If there is a mix-up. You call to explain not call and talk like you are doing me a favor. Didnâ€™t even let me talk neither did she explain clearly, Hung...up and sent me a message -call the rider.
I order your shawarma for my colleagues cus i get attended to faster than when they order by themselves. You can check the whatsapp chats. So if there is a mistake ,you call and explain and not talk rudely to me. Please teach your employees.More",25,May-22,3,Farmcity
chrisbkresdt,Poor service,"After waiting for almost 40 minutes, wife had to go fetch a waiter. Then we were served without cutlery while the food was getting cold. Also served an item we did not ask for.
Generally bad service for a well located restaurant. Does not justify...the crowd that troop in there. This is my 3rd visit and they have not improved over the period of timeMore",35,Apr-22,3,Farmcity
oluwafisayomif,farmcity experience,"nice location, beautiful ambiance with a sea view, the food well served. its a place i love to go over and again",10,Oct-19,3,Farmcity
Oafab,Typical Nigeria (Trash),"This restaurant is terrible !!!, they cheap out on staff the one thing  Nigeria has in abundance (labour). Like even in the supermarkets they have two people for every purchase here your waiter and her manager donâ€™t care one bit. Went twice and both times...I was fighting to even get served and pay my bill. DO NOT GO HERE they will make you spend half your time waiting. Management is trash and quite clearly they thrive on Nigerian mediocrity.More",40,Jan-20,3,Farmcity
945gladyso,NEVER GOT MY ORDER,..I had ordered and paid with my card for a grilled cat fish and never got a delivery. several calls to their number was futile. my call was never picked nor my money refunded.,30,Dec-19,3,Farmcity
Happi123,Very stale food(Rancid),"I have just placed an order for chicken with chips and found out that it was spoilt. I knew the moment I opened it as I perceived the smell.
It is rather terrible that someone will spend their hard-earned money to come to your spot,...only for you to serve them rancid food.
This horrible to say the least and I will never buy food from FARMCITY ever.        
People beware if you do not want food poisoning, stay away from this place.
They were lucky I sent someone over to buy it or I would have rained hell on them today.More",10,Nov-19,3,Farmcity
NonemekCreativity,This place can be crowded...,"This is one of the places you can come in any time, i mean time of the day/night. They run 24 hrs service. hmmm. offering various cuisines, in and out dining, etc. just a lovely place to be with groups and family.",40,Jan-19,3,Farmcity
FolaO,Terrible food,"I placed an online order with Farm City Lekki. The online process was quite seamless. I received a call confirming my order. I arrived to pick up the 2 x grilled fish I ordered. 
On arriving home, I decided to try the Croaker fish. It...was horrible. It was very black. It was not garnished. Please see picture below. It tasted off and stank. 
The second fish looked equally as ghastly, but has not been touched.suttibg in the freezer.  It was accompanied by sautÃ©ed potatoes and they had gone off. They just stank badly and had to be binned. 
I called farm city and they were not receptive. They also refused to let me speak with the manager. Itâ€™s a waste of my N7,600. 
I will be avoiding the place like the plague. 
Please do not order the grilled fish. Unless mine was a really bad run. In which case an apology from Farm City would have sufficed.More",10,Jul-19,3,Farmcity
Ade703,Decent hangout spot,"Farm city is a nice hangout spot. It has both outdoor and indoor sitting areas, the food is good and relatively inexpensive. It's usually a bit crowded but you'll likely still find space to sit down and enjoy your food. The outdoor area is lagoon-facing...so the view is quite nice. There's a good variety of options in both the food and drinks menu. 

Not a bad place overall.More",10,Jun-19,3,Farmcity
Sushil S,Nice view with great ambience,"We went there for hangout during the weekend, were setting down the sea side space, I must say location is really nice and give you a pleasant feel but service is well below standard (you will have to go around and find the waiter to...place your order) it can take infinite time to have your order on table.More",10,Feb-19,3,Farmcity
PlaneJane13,Nice location along the water,"Decent food here, traditional Nigerian dishes as well as plenty of drinks to choose from. The cocktails didnâ€™t taste so fresh so I stayed with bottled beers but overall it was reasonably priced on a good location for evenings and also a live DJ. Iâ€™m...a foreigner and felt comfortable here, for Lekki, itâ€™s a perfect spot to visit.More",40,Feb-19,3,Farmcity
Dupri00,Nice sit out by the sea,"Good sit out just by the sea. Has a floating bar and then an inner area which has air-conditioning. Offers breakfast, lunch and a lounge experience in the evening.

Positives:
- Excellent fish barbecue (Spicy so be warned)
- Nice view if you sit by...the floating bar.
- Prices are fair for Lekki 1

Negatives:
- Water smells sometimes. Can be sickening.
- You will be seating right under high tension electricity cables if you sit by the floating bar.
- can be extremely busy and then parking becomes an issue

Overall, it is fair and offers a good hangout in Lekki 1.More",10,Jan-19,3,Farmcity

Sunday O,Ocean-view environment,"Nice location, ocean-view in high brow environment, adequate security but minimum/no consideration for customers parking.

Priscilla A,Nice Cocktails,"I've been to farmcity twice, mostly because of their nice mock/cocktails and also because you are literally on the ocean/lagoon as you sip your drink. They have nice pepper soup as well but can take forever to serve your meal.",50,Mar-17,3,Farmcity
bunmiOdez,Great place if you love fish,"Went with my colleagues last December. They had alot of clients but I believe its because it was during the festive period.
