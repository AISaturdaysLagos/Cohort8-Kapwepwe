EkeindeO,Faded but with little residual glory,"Went with the whole family and some friends. The drinks were not representative of the names on the menu. We had to send the Chapman back as the kids refused to drink it. I tried to struggle through but gave up. Wife’s daiquiri was off...as well. To their credit the server did take the Chapman we didn’t send back away. What came  to replace it wasn’t a whole lot better. Definitely not a Chapman. 

Food took a while to come. The starters left a lot to be desired. The batter on the prawns was thick and leathery. The hummus wasn’t anywhere near Double Four standards, wings were over cooked and spicer than promised and disappointingly the yam chips were neither crispy nor fully cooked.

The imprecise cooking continued with the mains, with the burger patties burnt on one side and the lambs chops almost cremated. The steak medallions in the surf and turf were like hockey pucks and all the prawns were rubbery. There were some redeeming elements; the food was well seasoned, and the waitress attentive. Still like the plywood and cheap wood strips used for many of their fixture, weathered and rotting away, the glory of the establishment seems to have been drained in the past few years, perhaps slowing flowing next door.More",45,December 2021,4.0
Roam52430971980,Bad experience,"Cesar Salad was good 
However
Lamp chops were like rubber could not even chew.
Had to fetch my own salt and drink which was waiting at the outside bar .
And when the waiter passed next to me he did not even rushed and  helped....
He was busy taking a pictures of another customer out in the patio. 

The mint lemon drink was good however the watermelon was the worst I have ever had .More",40,December 2021,4.0
DidiDidz,"Great cocktails, which I really","Great cocktails, which I really enjoyed. Lovely relaxed atmosphere, very chilled environment to enjoy a drink or 2! However, the issues started when it was time to pay; there were no card machines working and I had to trek to a cash point to get...cash; in this day and age of cashless this is sub standard; I won’t come back here as I don’t usually carry cash. They had 4 POS machines and none were working; what a pity!! Such potential but not able to realise it.More",40,March 2020,4.0

brokematerialgirl,Horrible,"So I remember when backyard first opened. The food was excellent. I made sure everyone I know tried the teriyaki chicken cos it was that good. Chunky strips of chicken done excellently with teriyaki sauce. Fast forward to yesterday- I had a craving for teriyaki...chicken so I braved traffic all the way from marina on a Friday to backyard. First indication of doom- it was empty at 1.30pm, parking lot empty and inside there was only 1 table occupied with 2  people. Everything in my head said RUN!  But I did not. My craving had to be satisfied. So I buy one portion of teriyaki chicken, garden salad and fries to go. 

I get back to the office and it is the most disappointing meal ever. It’s not teriyaki chicken- it’s teriyaki dough, thick dough smothered in too much teriyaki sauce. When I look at it I think “this is oddly shaped. Interesting.” I take a bite and I’m like “that’s not chicken” so I look down and examine the crap in my plate.  I literally opened up the thick, doughy exterior to find a tiny strip  of tasteless chicken. A strip thinner than KFC’s chicken strip but not anywhere near appealing to the eyes as KFC’s. It’s even slightly pink. Terrible. Most disappointing lunch ever. 

I ended up eating fries and a salad for lunch which they somehow got right. I feel robbed. If I didn’t know what the meal was like a few months before I probably would not feel this disappointed. Exploited. This was daytime robbery. 

The service was good though but I’m never going backMore",20,September 2019,4.0
Premium C,An afternoon at The Backyard Lagos,"We had nice cocktails - smoothies, tropicana and chapman - and grilled fish, burger etc

Decent outing generally. Go on wednesday evenings or weekends when it bubbles more. Budget N2-3k for cocktails, the whiskey. Rums etc could go up to 25k depending on the brand....Average N5k to N10 for a meal, and side.

Have fun and take pictures.More",10,August 2019,4.0

olajideo2013,Nice place,"I had some colleagues in from Ghana and was looking for a nice place to take them for drinks. Backyard did not disappoint. We chilled at the lovely outdoor bar, had beer and cocktails with grills. I had chicken suya and my colleagues had chicken...wings. The food was tasty and the vibe was on point.
