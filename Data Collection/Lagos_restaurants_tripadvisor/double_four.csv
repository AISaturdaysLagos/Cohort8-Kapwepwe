Cheelaks,Lovely place,I always look forward to visiting whenever I'm in Lagos.Their shredded chicken and rice is so tasty.,35,Sep-19,3.5,Double Four
KaiUWulff,"Solid comfort and lebanese food place, friendly service","Inside the mall building with friendly staff, large portions and a good selection of comfort food choices. Not the place for a healthy meal but a nice place before or after shopping to relax and meet friends.",40,Apr-19,3.5,Double Four
AmitMAgrawal,Nice Lebanese dinner!,"Was visiting Lagos and was taken our for dinner by my friends in the city to Double Four.

Was a pleasant surprise to see an option of outside seating in a city with security concerns. We all sat outside and it was quite nice in...terms of seating and lights.

We had ordered Lebanese food and it was good quality. Not the best I have had but quite nice. The hot Lebanese bread was available that always makes such a big difference to the food experience.

The various servings were quite OK. The service was acceptable though not the best. Food got served without the cutlery at times and needed follow up.

Overall a decent place to head to for a nice evening and for Lebanese food in town.More",40,Sep-17,3.5,Double Four

Ibadanboy,Nice!,"44-Double Four is a nice Lebanese style restaurant. It serves tasty fresh food in a cozy environment. Good food, good service, good place",30,Apr-16,3.5,Double Four
Ibadanboy,Double 4,"This is restaurant that takes me back in time. Great food, one of the first real restaurants that served nice Nigerian food in an upmarket environment. Still going strong, but totally outdone by the new entrants in the F&B market. Good food, nice service, good...locationMore",50,Mar-16,3.5,Double Four
rohits45,Rohit Sidhwani,The food in the new location in Victoria Island is nothing great. The service was bad and even the food was not of the same standard they used to serve in Ikoyi. A total disappointment.,40,May-16,3.5,Double Four
mstphy,Ambience with lots of food choices,"We went for lunch and eat outside. This would be a great place in the evenings. Portions were BIG, but not the best fattoush salad I've had. Also the Sakura restaurant so lots of food choices. Friendly waitstaff. Close to 9 to 7 supermarket.",40,Mar-16,3.5,Double Four
Ravi D,DOUBLE 44 has returned to Saka Jojo Street - same location as Sakura,"Chef Hassan of Al Basha fame has returned to work his magic with great Lebanese food at the Double 44 in the same place as Sakura.

wikotan,Quite Average-The Palms,"If you are looking for a place with service standards...I suggest you manage your expectations! The food is just ok but quality varies depending on how busy the place is...You may also prompt for service a couple of times since the team has not yet...mastered the art of ""working under pressure""...well atleast you can have a view of everyone walking into the mall as you wait.More",40,Jul-15,3.5,Double Four
ZeeGoes,average,"not worth the buzz. My friends grew up going here, and it used to be known for serving good food, so I decided to try it out. It was pretty average...I can't even remember what I ate, probably some variation of pizza",20,Aug-14,3.5,Double Four
adrianrockall,Wet Sunday afternoon,"On a quick shopping trip to the palms , on a wet Sunday afternoon, the place was not as busy as I have seen when passing previously , so I stopped for a beer and burger , seems like a place to be seen ,...lots of people just chilling before or after their shopping , the service was quick and the food came in about 10 mins , and was tasty . Definitely come back , I bet it does get busy at peak times .More",40,Jun-15,3.5,Double Four
ngolo,Hidden Gem,"This place on Awolowo Road must rank as one of the hidden gems of Lagos. Some people believe restaurants trade off décor for good taste and vice versa, I guess that is the case here. In terms of décor, there isn’t much, you enter and...it’s like “Did I make a mistake?” Wait until the food shows up, then you understand why most of the other people in there are old customers. The food is amazingly good and the portion sizes are big!

The Chicken cordon bleau is so good it actually tastes better than what I got at a fancy place in Montreal! Then the pizza  which comes from a wood burning oven? Nuff said.

My wife and I keep saying we won’t go back until the décor is fixed but the sheer taste of their food keeps bringing us back. I really wish the owners would spruce the place up but then I guess the food will start tasting like that of other 44 outlets . . . now, that would be a poor trade off.More",40,Feb-15,3.5,Double Four
Aly E,Good restaurant for lunch/brunch,"Double 44 is a nice enough bar/restaurant at Palms Shopping Mall.  Restaurant inside is quite pleasant, clean and well furnished.  Staff are friendly and reasonably efficient.  The menu is quite large and we would personally recommend the tuna and philly steak sandwich if you fancy...a bite to eat for lunch (bit pricey but nice enough).  We do have to say that the wine measures are very generous and quite welcome after a shop!  There is also a bakery that sells a good selection of cakes and breads alongside an ice cream bar (although haven't used that yet)!More",50,Jan-15,3.5,Double Four

Elizabeth A,Good but could be better with a great management!!,"There is nothing wrong with the Double Four Franchise, as other branches in Lagos are flourishing< the palms< ikoyi club< and international airport.. all doing well with the proper management.

Tayo A,The new double four is way classier,"The new double four @ The Palms lekki is classier and nicer, you get to shop at the mall then have a good meal at the restaurant. Nice affordable meals. Upstairs s the soul lounge where there is an bar with an amazing view",40,,3.5,Double Four
