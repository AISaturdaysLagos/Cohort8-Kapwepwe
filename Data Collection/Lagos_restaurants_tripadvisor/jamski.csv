NaijaBabe2016,DELICIOUS & TRULY AUTHENTIC JAMAICAN CUISINE! üëåüèΩüëèüèºüëçüèΩ,"Jamski has become a must-visit location for me when in Lagos- (which is a rarity). Ever since I tried Jamski's sublime cuisine for the first time last year, I was totally hooked! Island Food- (most notably Jamaican Fare), is one of my favourite cuisines. And...it's worth mentioning that this particular type of food is hard to come by anywhere in Nigeria, so coming to Jamski is always a special treat for me. I met the amazingly delightful PAPA JAMSKI last year and his fabulous daughter PRINCESS JAMSKI. Their charm, friendliness, presence and extraordinary personality is 'the icing on the cake' at Jamski! This 'dynamic duo' are some of the loveliest people you will ever meet! üòç They make the experience at Jamski all the more pleasurable and memorable! ü•∞

My daughter had never tried Jamaican Food, so I decided to order some of their most famous and enduring classics. I'm familiar with Jamski's very varied menu, to which I gave a very detailed description in my last/first review of the restaurant. For this visit, we went for ESCOVITCH FISH (Rice, Peas, Plantain), a side of JERK CHICKEN and an OXTAIL MEAL (Rice, Peas, Plantain). For our drinks, we got one SORREL and one COCONUT WATER. We also ordered BEEF PATTY and CHICKEN PATTY, (2 each), for take-away. As usual, everything was simply delicious- packed with all those vibrant, tropical, spicy, Islandy flavours I love about Jamaican Food!üòã The Jerk Chicken was slightly dry and underseasoned. It didn't taste fresh, and it was like it hadn't been marinated for some time prior to grilling, so the seasoning(s) didn't penetrate the chicken. I found the Oxtail, Escovitch Fish, Rice & Peas and Patties to be absolutely sumptuous. My daughter thought the Escovitch Fish lacked flavor, but loved the vinegary pickled vegetables on top, and the hints of coconut in the Rice & Peas. She also thought the Sorrel (Zobo) drink was too pepperish. My Coconut Water tasted very ordinary.

So again, the experience at Jamski ends up being another 'slam dunk'- (at least as far as I'm concerned). It seems that in my eyes, Jamaican Cuisine can do no wrong; especially when you get to interact with hosts as exemplary as PAPA JAMSKI and PRINCESS JAMSKI. The folks here are simply wonderful! üëèüèº It's always so nice to see these incredible people, and I'd like to say a big thank you to them for catering to us so well as usual, and for all their warmth and TLC. The prices at Jamski are very competitive. We payed under 30 thousand naira for our food, including an extra Chicken Meal for our Chauffeur. I'm also thrilled that my daughter got to sample Jamaica Cuisine. She was very impressed by it, and finally understand why I fuss so much about it! üòÑ I look forward to hopefully visiting Jamski yet again, (the next time I visit Lagos); perhaps with a different family member! The food here is so authentic and impressive, so please endeavor to check out Jamski- Home Of The Jamaican Patty.......and so much more!!!More",45,August 2022,4.5

NaijaBabe2016,JAMAICAN CUISINE @ IT'S ABSOLUTE FINEST!!! ü•ê üçú ü•ò üçõüçπ,"Jamaican Food is one of my favorite types of cuisine ever.  I knew about Jamski Restaurant, because my husband once brought me some yummy Jamaican Patties from them.  I hardly ever visit Lagos; so when I happened to do so, Jamski was most definitely on...my 'bucket-list' of places to visit.  First and foremost, I have to give an 'honorable mention' to PRINCESS.  I had difficulty locating Jamski, so I ended up calling the restaurant for directions.  Princess was of such tremendous help to me. Her seamless 'relatability and connectivity' is an irrefutable asset to any establishment!  She never hesitated to pick up my calls and was unwavering in her determination to get me to Jamski! üëçüèΩ Princess is a total Angel, üëºüèΩ and I truly appreciate her assistance.

When I did eventually find Jamski, it was such an adorable gem of a place; almost a shack-like eatery.  Jamski is a lively, high-spirited environment, what with all the vivid and radiant imagery depicted throughout.  Green, yellow and black- (the colours of the Jamaican flag) were dutifully and liberally used all over Jamski.  The islandy, tropical decor of Jamski came in the form of stunning murals and oil murals in naturalistic outdoor settings, which adorned the interior, as well as the exterior.  This captured an upbeat, festive Carribean vibe. It was all so, so legit and authentic! üòÅ  I particularly loved the bold images the bold images of everybody's favorite 'Son of Jamaica' BOB MARLEY!  One was outside and one was inside, (refer to pictures posted).  Just catching a glimpse of the image of this global cultural, legendary musical icon, always puts me in a great mood!  I consider this cornerstone of Jamaican Pop Culture, Pioneer of Reggae Music, Heroic Advocate of Pan-Africanism to be one of the coolest people that ever lived! üòé ü§ûüèΩ

Inside Jamski Restaurant, you had pictures/portraits of star athletes and Olympic Gold Medalists hanging on the wall, and a bold image of  Usain Bolt striking his trademark 'lighting bolt' or 'to di world' pose.  A gigantic map of Jamaica was an interesting visual treat to perceive.  There were 2 parts to Jamski Restaurant; one seemed to be a bit more casual- (located by the entrance), and the interior part, a bit more cozy and intimate.  The National Anthem of Jamaica was on full display, and Jamski's placemats were of the Jamaica flag.  The words 'One Love' also made a notable 'cameo' on a high wall.  I also adored how the ""J"" in Jamski's title had on a Tam (Rastacap)- the crocheted, colored cap typically associated with the Rastafari lifestyle! All these heart-warming Jamaican accoutrements and memorabilia lent an uplifting, cool ambiance to Jamski.  It's worth mentioning that I ran into the owner of Jamski. His name was PAPA JAMSKI. This delightful gentleman was absolutely lovely!  He was charming, funny, jovial, cordial, accommodating, warm-hearted, and super pleasant!  I enjoyed chatting with him, and he made me feel very welcome.  PRINCESS was so lovely as well.  She was so professional, friendly and hospitable.  What a fantastic family! üòç

The menu at Jamski Restaurant is out-of-this-world amazing!  The hard copy menu itself is an attractive, colorful, glossy affair with a picture of every single food item on the menu. Very visually descriptive!  This makes it easy for customers who aren't too familiar with Jamaican Cuisine to make their selections.  There were Entrees, A La Carte and Combo meals available.  Jamski's Entrees were mostly served with Rice, Peas & Fried Plantains.  Entrees included items like Seafood Rundun (RunDown), Escoveitch Fish, Ackee & Salt, Brown Stew, Jerk Roasted Fish, Curry Chicken/Pork/Goat, Salt Fish with Broad Beans/Cabbage, Brown Stew Chicken, Roast Beef, Steamed Fish, Jerk Pork, Roast Beef, my all time favorite- Brown Stew Oxtail and Jerk Chicken of course.  For the entrees that aren't served with Rice, Peas & Plantain, you get Steamed Vegetables, Boiled Green Banana & Bolied Yam. 

For the A La Carte Menu, items included Curry Vegetables & Beans Delight, Curry Snails, Curry Prawns, Curry Goat Wrap, Chicken/Fish Soup, Jamski BBQ Wings, Jamski Chicken Wrap,Jamski One Pot, Jamski Fried Rice, Jamski Chicken Wings, Red Peas Soup, Prawns & Chicken Stir-Fry, Roast Beef, Seafood Rundown, Pumpkin Soup, Popcorn Chicken, Jamski Alfredo Pasta, Goat Soup (spicy mannish wata), plus the usual 'classics' like Jerk Pork, Roasted Fish, Roasted Curry Oxtail, Curry Jerk Chicken, Curry Goat, Escoveitch Fish, Brown Stew Chicken and Ackee Salt. The Combo Meals at Jamski are Beef Patty & Coco Bread, Callalo Loaf with Sweet Potatoes Wedges, Popcorn Chicken & Tallawah Bites, Meat Loaf with Sweet Potato Wedges, Jerk Chicken & Sweet Potato Wedges, Jerk Chicken Loaf, Salt Fish Loaf & Pieces of Jerk Chicken, Cheese Patties & Coco Bread, Callaloo Loaf, Jerk Chicken & Coleslaw, Jerk BBQ Wings, Festival (sweetened fried dough) & Sweet Potato Wedges, Jerk Chicken, Festival with Coleslaw, Meat Loaf with Jerk Chicken, Jerk Pork, Festival with Coleslaw, Brown Stew Oxtail and Brown Stew Chicken, Festival, Fried Ripe Plantain & Coleslaw.  Side Dishes include Salt Fish Fritters, Steamed Veggies, Festival, Sweet Potato Wedges, Mac & Cheese and Plantains. 

They had a colorful fridgeful of home-made alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.  This variety of 'elixirs' were mostly laced with one of Jamaica's most well-known exploits- Rum! Of course, Rum Punch, as well as other cocktail-like offerings in plastic bottles were available.  Mixed Fruit, Pina Colada, Lemon/Ginger, Sorrel and other non-alcoholic mix-ups were also on offer.  There was also a shelf stocked full of house-made jerk sauces and marinades.  I ordered the Jerk Chicken and Brown Stew Oxtail Entrees, plus a Mixed Fruit Mocktail to go, as I was in s hurry.  Just as I expected, everything tasted incredible; cooked  with Princess's love, heart and soul! üòã The chicken was spicy and flavorful, and the oxtail was smooth and melts-in-your-mouth velvety!  It tasted truly authentic, and brought back so many fun memories of my University days in Southern Florida, where I grew to love this enduring Caribbean cuisine.  Wish I got to have the Jamaican Patty, but there just wasn't enough time to grill them. 

So in conclusion, I cannot say enough nice and positive things about Jamski.  This place is a resplendent and wholesome joint!  I don't know why the song by Jimmy Cliff, 'Wonderful World, Beautiful People' kept reverberating in my head for some reason! ü§î I hope this isn't an offensive cliche or inappropriate stereotype; however, these are the words that seemed to 'rotate' in my head and mind in regards to PAPA JAMSKI and PRINCESS who are just that-.....Wonderful People....! in their 'Wonderful World'! üòÑ  It was fascinating to me to see Papa Jamski sitting down to write a new menu for the restaurant.  I thought to myself, 'what else could he possibly add to this vast, diverse and expansive menu?' 'what more delectable Island treats could he additionally include?'.  Since I definitely plan on returning to Jamski, by the special grace of Almighty God, it would be interesting to see what additions he'll make!  Wish him the best of luck there. üëçüèΩ  I look forward to dining in next time.  My overall experience at Jamski was fantabulous; from the delicious food, to the warm ambiance to my jolly interactions.  The only frank criticism I would impart on Jamski is that the fried plantain was cut too thin.  It seemed more like soft plantain chips, so I would kindly urge them to slice their plantains a little more thickly please.  I want to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to PAPA JAMSKI and PRINCESS 'JAMSKI', (as I fondly named her!). ü§ó  Their down-to-earth candour, friendly demeanor and pure professionalism is unparalleled and they should be extremely proud of their impressive establishment!  I loved coming here, and Iook forward to returning in the not-too-distant future to sample as much as their awesome options as possible. YEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH MAN!!! üëåüèΩüôÖüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§ûüèΩ  Jamski Restaurant is your one stop shop for fantastic Jamaican Cuisine in Lagos, so I highly, highly, highly recommended it!

Y6571FYandyc,It's As Laid Back as Jamaica!!,"This is not fine dining. It's a few tables with Jamaican placemats, murals of Bob Marley on the wall and no two glasses the same!! The service is not the quickest and the food won't necessarily arrive all at the same time.

But you know...what? It doesn't matter (unless you're an obsessive compulsive). It's Jamaican!! You will get a warm welcome from Emmanual and his wife knows how to turn out very tasty Jamaican food. Most of my friends are fans of their signature patties - me less so. But I have tried most of the menu over a period of months. The Brown Stew Oxtail (like all the brown stew dishes) is meaty and thick with a sticky barbecue sauce. The Jerk Chicken is great but my favourite is the Jamski One Pot where you get a little bit of everything and its served with rice and peas and some plantain.

You can bet that the background music will be reggae (what else would you expect). And I can recommend the Jamaican Rum Punch (which is what it packs!) or for non-alcohol drinkers a Banana punch.

If you looking for fine dining or regimented service delivery this may not be for you. If you want a fun, chilled out evening, some good food and the chance to relax I highly recommend Jamski.More",50,April 2019,4.5

Its warm,...welcoming owner (Emmanuel) and staff, together with its tropics/Reggae-inspired decor and iconography adds the perfect finishing touch to the chilled-out, island-life experience.
