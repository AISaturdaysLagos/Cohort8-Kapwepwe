Wabe1816,"Flavorful, Economic Sunday Brunch","I dined at this establishment with a few coworkers for Sunday brunch. There were a variety of dishes available; however, the absence of cards with food descriptions in English made it difficult to truly enjoy the fare. All of the signs were in transliterated Hindi,...which was not helpful for people, like myself, who do not speak/read/understand Hindi. None of my co-workers could figure out the content of the dishes. As a result, we had to test a bit of everything, which turned out to be an uncomfortable experience as many of the dishes were very spicy/hot. Another downside is that the restaurant did not have mango lassi, which is an Indian restaurant staple. Overall, the price of the brunch is relatively economic - everything in Lagos that isn't Nigerian is expensive - and the food was relatively tasty. I would not partake in the buffet again, though, as I barely got through one plate.  Nevertheless, I would buy a dish a la cart.More",40,Jul-19,4,Gurunar's Viceroy Restaurant

imsam,Good Place to catch up with your friends,"Being there to hang out on a weekend with some friends. The Buffet spread is good enough to have a good brunch. Added advantage is that they include unlimited beer (limited brands) in the buffet price.
The vegetarian spread was good and the taste was...average. The n0n-vegeterain dishes were not great. The Afghani Boti was a bit under cooked and didn't enjoy it.
The whole exercise was to meet the friend have a goog beer and enjoy the food in their company.More",50,Jun-19,4,Gurunar's Viceroy Restaurant
