Lovejenxx,Outstanding,"This has to be one of the nicest restaurants I‚Äôve been to in Lagos. Food was amazing I had the butternut squash pasta and it was simply divine. Also I would definitely recommend getting the sangria !!!! 

It‚Äôs quiet and they have a nice outdoor...area if you feel  just having a couple of drinks will definitely go back.More",45,January 2022,4.5
kunlea2013,Very good food. Nice environment.,"Very good food. Nice environment. My wife‚Äôs favourite place though she complained a bit on our last visit. She felt her salmon was too dry and didn‚Äôt taste as good as she remembered and she insisted something had changed. Upon enquiry they had recently changed...their chef. Hmmm, really hope they fix this before my wife‚Äôs next visit.More",50,October 2020,4.5
Ade703,Nice small chill spot,"Sabor is a nice, relaxed chill spot, perfect for a lazy and casual evening out. It's a bit small but that adds to the cosy feel; the food is good and our order arrived in just under 30 minutes, cocktails are good as well. Prices...are about the same as you'd expect from your regular lagos spot. The place has an indoor sitting area as well as a balcony so there's a place for everyone. 

Overall not bad at all.More",40,January 2020,4.5
Adaora U,OMG SABOR!!,"Went to celebrate a colleagues promotion with the boss and a few others! 

My sister recommended the restaurant, I‚Äôd never heard of it so I went searching for reviews on their Instagram. Boy was I glad we chose SABOR. Unarguably the best food I‚Äôve had...in a lagos restaurant. Everybody‚Äôs order came out perfect - I know cos I had a bite from everyone üòÖ I was that excited and if you know me, you know I appreciate good food.

Very understated, SABOR was like a best kept secret. Worth every penny.
A bit hot outside when we got there but things cooled down as the evening wore on!More",40,February 2019,4.5

gaziedecker,Loved it!,"There is no signage outside but the succulent cuisine stakes a mental signpost that would lead one back to savor the Sabor experience. Whilst not occupying the largest floor space, the waiters make up for it with warm service. 

Their meals are decent-sized, well-presented and...very delicious. However, perhaps most delightful is their competitive pricing, especially for fine dinning on Victoria Island, Lagos.More",40,May 2019,4.5

Madgie M,More than lived up to my expectations.,"The seafood platter is excellent! Please don't try eating that alone, you can't finish it. The sweet potato fries looked quite chunky and so I was skeptical at first however, the taste was awesome. Customer service is really good here as well. Really laid back,...not too formal environment üëçüèøMore",50,February 2019,4.5

Rahmon S,Great Ambiance,"Dining in Lagos is usually a hit or miss OR you get the 'Ham"" with no burger (meaning at least one aspect of the dining experience is totally off).  EVERY TIME I come here (and it'a been quite often within the last couple of months),...I've been pleasantly serviced.  The food and drinks are nice. Pasta dishes are yummy, drinks are delicately prepared, appetizers make me want more food.  Quality is consistent. Another thing that strike me is how attentive the servers are.  They make eye contact and quickly provide your needs w/o making you feel that they're strained. I've been here as a couple, with friends, and cozy girlfriend date for both afternoon and dinner and so far so good.More",40,August 2018,4.5

Lamide21,Great food!,"I had been wanting to eat at Sabor after my sister had raved about it..several times! I pegged it down as an ideal lunch spot on a Sunday after Mass. Many Sundays came and went, still no Sabor.
So finally, a friend‚Äôs birthday was coming...up and I decided to take her there the day after her celebration. 
Let me get the negatives out of the way.... Sabor is not signposted. You‚Äôll be squinting and pointing like a fool before you‚Äôll find it. Actually we ended up asking a security guard. Fortunately, it turned out to be the building next door. 
The decor is minimalist but not at all pretensious. It has an intimate and familiar feeling.The space is smaller than I expected but you get a great view of the hustle and bustle of V.I, without the noise.
The staff are EXCELLENT. Friendly and attentive without the nuisance factor.
For drinks, I had a pineapple, coconut cream and lime mocktail. Initially it didn‚Äôt seem as sweet as I would have liked, but the flavour developed with each sip and it got progressively sweeter.
My calamari starter was delicious. I am obsessed with calamari and often judge a restaurant by the quality of its calamari ( yes, newly refurbished Cactus restaurant, I am looking at you, with your ridiculously thin and tough unhappy looking calamari). The calamari came with a choice of two types of relish. The creamy and spicy one was divine.
For my main, I ordered a chicken salad. The pretty and dimpled cheeked chef came and politely asked if I would like goat‚Äôs cheese instead of the feta listed on the menu. They were out of feta. She also suggested other replacement options that I can‚Äôt quite remember.I opted for the goat‚Äôs cheese.
When the salad arrived, I thought it looked quite boring. All the ingredients were arranged neatly in their own section. Nothing had been tossed. I also expected strips of chicken, but all I had were teeny tiny cubes. I sadly poured the dressing, a creamy concoction, over the salad, and resigned myself to a lacklustre lunch.....and then POW! The flavours! This was one of the tastiest salads I‚Äôve ever had!! 
Then came dessert. The waiter recommended the nut brownie with salted caramel and vanilla ice cream.Now I don‚Äôt usually like brownies.And I also know from bitter experience that many of the finest restaurants ,in my beloved Lagos, have consistently let me down when it comes to ‚Äú pudding‚Äù.
I am pleased to announce that Sabor‚Äôs dessert was an absolute triumph. I could go on and on about this place, but I have clearly written more than enough. Thank you Sabor, and bravo!More",40,July 2018,4.5
Stephanie O,Such a cool spot!,"Hello Madge,

GlobeTrotter_Marthy,My visit to Sabor was AMAZING,Went to Sabor for the first time with a friend. The staff was quite knowledgeable about the menu and was able to recommend a lot of dishes. Their menu has a lot of food and drink options. I went with the Tagliatelle pasta with butternut...squash and ricotta and added chicken. For drink I got the rosemary gin fizz‚Äîa bit on the sweet side. Service and ambience was good. Would definitely visit again!More,50,July 2018,4.5
