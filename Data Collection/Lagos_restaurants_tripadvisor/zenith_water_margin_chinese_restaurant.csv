Onlyoneodini,Customer Service is KEY,My mum chose this location for her birthday and the service was poor. I'm not sure if it was that they were not expecting to have to serve a larger number of people at a time or they were lean on staff. The soup was...cold and the reason was cos they were expecting us earlier than we got there. The service was slow as we had one person brining the food. We kept looking for them to get one thing or the other. There were 5 different sauces  and only 2 were served while we were eating. The other 3 came when we were almost done. Though the evening ended well but i would stick to ordering take out than using the venue for another event.More,50,May 2016,4.0

OnyekaChima,"Ambiance, Food, Staff","I enjoyed the mean with a host of my friends and while we had to wait it was worth it. The fruit juices were freshly made, the shrimp soup and fried rice were all just too sumptuous. One downer though and though not uncommon is...having to have your card declined. you would have to walk a few meters to an ATM.

This is Lagos and worth the experience, its in the heart of Lagos so really swell stuff.More",40,September 2015,4.0
