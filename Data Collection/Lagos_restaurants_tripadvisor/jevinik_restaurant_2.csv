Rolf605,My first Nigeria Cuisine experience,"My local Nigerian friends brought me here.  I had a great time here.  Especially the food are inexpensive and tasty.  Must try the Moi Moi.

MsY L,Tried to charge me 3 time!!!,"I have never written a review about any restaurant, but my experience at Jevnik today was lower than low. I went with a friend. They charged his card and said transaction declined. They charged my card and said transaction was declined. Then we got alerts...that the transaction had gone thru. The decline receipt they printed afterwards was exactly the same for my friend and I. It had no information about either of our cards - no name, no card number, no transaction value. The manager was rude and argued that this was normal and the bank would reverse it. We called our banks (both GTB). They said the transaction had gone thru without any query. So it would not have been reversed. I believe the staff tried to cheat us, thinking we would not notice. They did not seem surprised, it was as though this is normal. If I could give zero stars for this experience, I would have!!!More",40,December 2018,4.0
