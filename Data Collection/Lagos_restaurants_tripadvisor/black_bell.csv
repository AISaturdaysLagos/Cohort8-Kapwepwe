Tribabs,Poor customers service,Black Bell has wonderful meals but the down sides is the customer service personnels. How can order and pay for food only to be told 10 mins later that the food is unavailable? Not the 1st time the service delivery is poor!,10,Jun-21,3,Black Bell

harrypN6936AEh,Trying to Order over the phone,Not impressed with the way I was attended to over the phone trying to place an order and it was like I was say black bell should pay for my food. The attendant didn‚Äôt even take my order complete and the just cut me off...the phone. That‚Äôs insulting and you should(black bell)take notes so you don‚Äôt end up losing customers trying you out for the first time. I tried black bell at lekki and I say it‚Äôs was a different thing for ikeja.More,10,Nov-20,3,Black Bell

Jasmine M,Friday Night Fun!,"My boyfriend and I visited this spot on a Friday night. We got food from the main level and took it upstairs to the lounge. The food was good and fresh, we enjoyed jollof rice, plantain, and a turkey wing. The lounge was cute and...comfy! There was live music, the musicians were interactive and lively. We went back to this place for lunch on a weekday. Jollof rice wasn‚Äôt available and the staff was a bit disorganized. They seem to get a big lunch rush. Overall we would recommend this place to others, especially the lounge for relaxing entertainment.More",50,Jan-20,3,Black Bell

Olelebisa,Terrible Sassy staff upon spoilt turkey,"I just had a large meal of seafood okra with turkey and snail. While I have been a daily lunch time customer of the place, today the turkey was spoilt and the attendant at the cash point sarcastically said ‚Äòeiya sorry‚Äô make ridicule of me...in public for a service I‚Äôm paying for. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd like to be treated like that now would you?More",50,Dec-19,3,Black Bell

Ayo O,Affordable Tasty Meals,"Black Bell is a well located eatery on the busy Adeola Odeku street. The building facade and the interior are contemporary and very clean, and the parking lot takes about ten cars.

You may enjoy sweet treats from the bakery or help yourself to the...broad range of local delicacies from various parts of Nigeria. 

However, you may be required, mid-meal, to come out to relocate your vehicle. 
Furthermore, the serving staff members need to smile and exude warmth, as you wonder if they think their tasks drudgery 

Overall, a good experience with room for improvement.More",30,Sep-18,3,Black Bell
