_abisheart,coffee machine at the cafe wasn‚Äôt working resulting in long wait,"went on a sunday for coffees and a chat at the cafe on the ground floor. 
The Lady serving at the cafe  disappeared for 25 minutes . when my friend got up to ask what was going on we were told that the machine at...the cafe was broken so she had to use the one at the main bar. 
This was only communicated when we asked .  we got to the bar and the coffees were not ready !!! 
it took nearly 40 minutes in total to get the coffees. all we required was an explanation that the machine wasn‚Äôt working at the cafe and we would have decided on what WE wanted to do .
It was Sunday buffet and the music was super loud so it wasn‚Äôt really an enjoyable experience trying to chat over coffee at the bar next to the restaurant .
Someone i assume was a manager did come to apologize and removed one coffee from the bill. However the overall experience was not great!More",40,July 2019,3.5
