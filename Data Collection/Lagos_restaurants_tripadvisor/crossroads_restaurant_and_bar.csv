JusticeJoyce,"Out of Chips. Why, Lord?!","Out of Chips. How Sway?! 

Dined in on a Saturday night about 6pm.
Planned for this all week. Started to order chips and salsa + guac then asked,  ""or is it provided?""
Server: we're out madame. 
Me: for a few hours or until when? 
Server:...Tuesday 

Y'all! 

What works:
* Refried beans 
* Fajitas but not the bell peppers. They're bitter. 
* Live Band 
* Clean restroom 
* Outdoor patio 

What can improve:
* Separate the guac and sour cream for this price point they should arrive in their own ramekins. 
* More tortillas or make hand pressed flour tortillas instead of the store bought. It'd really elevate the fajitas.
* Prices. Although I recognize this is a hotel restaurant and they are catering to us travelers... TexMex is cost effective and accessible to all. The fine dining prices keep so many from enjoying the sabor desde TexMex.

Mark H,Smoking allowed - disgusting,"Only one thing you need to know.  The restaurant tolerates people smoking at the tables despite the fact that it is illegal.  No matter the quality of the food or service, it is to be avoided like the plague.",50,Dec-18,3.5,Crossroads Restaurant and Bar
irishboy4,Flouting the ban on smoking law.,"There is total ban on smoking in bars and restaurants in Nigeria. This place actively encourages customers to smoke. Estimates say around 600,000 people die from inhaling second hand smoke each year, Crossroads was so smokey it was difficult to see. I asked the waitress...if there was a no smoking area and she said no. Likewise the manager said all were free to smoke. Nice music, nice food but expensive and chances are you will likely develop a lung condition or worse lung cancer.More",50,Oct-18,3.5,Crossroads Restaurant and Bar
