mrsfakorede,Bubble Tea in Nigeria!,"What are the odds that there's a bubble tea shop in Nigeria? Well there is, and it's a great place to hang out.  They even have board games to play with. They have great bubble tea because the owner was trained in Taiwan but her...bubble waffles are even better than the ones we have back home made by the asains. The owner was such a great host as well. She gave us great recommendations for what to do, where to eat and a cheaper mode of transportation. Trust me, this place will not disappoint!More",50,August 2018,5.0
