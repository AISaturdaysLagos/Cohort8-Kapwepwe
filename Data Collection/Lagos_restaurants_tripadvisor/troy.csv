anniemC2911QJ,I ended up at Salma's instead,Tried to visit yesterday afternoon for drinks with a friend. This bar is on a close with a narrow road and there were cars parked all the way down. There was one spot which 'security' blocked off directing us to find where to park by...ourselves. So we went to Salma's. Because I can't be begging people to take my money.More,25,Dec-18,2.5,Troy
