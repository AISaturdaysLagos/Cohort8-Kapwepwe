funlolaogun,Poor service,"My journey with my coffee started with the Adetokunbo Ademola branch where I have keenly followed its growth and success.
Today my heart sank at the level of service offered at the wings branch.
Notably a lot of new staff and it showed in the...level of service.
My coffee is one of my favourite spots for breakfast and I would hate to not want to come here based on my experience in the past couple of weeks.
Hopefully this changes .
PS Sulaiman and George can be pleasant, it doesnâ€™t hurt at a serviced restaurant.
I really want this to change please and thank you.More",20,Mar-19,2,Top Beans Coffee and More
