SlavkoZivkovic,Best food in Lagos,"This is my favorite spot in Lagos. Excellent food, the staff is really friendly, the shish tawook and the falafel is brilliant. Would also recommend a fresh pineapple juice for refreshing during the normal high heat in Nigeria.There are playgrounds for kids, a football court,...plus you can watch football if there is a match on, ask from the Staff if they can put the channel on for you. If you have dinner there, have Shisha afterwards and just relax.More",50,June 2017,4.5

Roobel,Very satisfying experience,"Amazing place just beside the Syrian Mosque, Ribadu Road, Lagos. Excellent for family. The place is replete with an outdoor sitting, a play pen for kids, a Football ground and a few rides for little kids. You even has shisha. We tried the sheesh Taouk...and kafka, Special Humus and the taboulleh salad. Each of them were perfect. Meet was juicy and done to perfection. The veg Pizza was good and the kids loved it. The service by the staff could have been a little better as they seemed to be confused all the time. The accompaniment garlic sauce was freshly prepared unlike the ready made mayo most restaurants serve. The ambience was very warm and comfortable. Crowd was good. The juices were fresh. 
Highly recommended. And those who are 
I went there twice. On my first visit they didn't charge for a second helping of the accompaniment of garlic sauce. But on my second visit, they said it chargeable. Found this very inconsistent. 
worried about food being halal , it's 100% halal. The place is also known as Sultans Pizza and fast food.More",50,March 2016,4.5
