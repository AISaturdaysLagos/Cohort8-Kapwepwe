Y6571FYandyc,"Fish yes, chips yes. Fish and chips never!!","Coming from the land of fish and chips and wanting a taste of home I visited Crust and Cream specifically for a 'fish and chip' supper. What was presented to me was what appeared to be a pile of goujons with chips. The 'fish' was...chewy and flavourless, cooked in breadcrumbs rather than batter which added to the chewiness a long way distant from the crispness of authentic fish and chips. I had to request salt and vinegar which took an age to arrive and when it did was white vinegar not malt vinegar The price of this culinary disaster was over N8,000.
The following night I went and enjoyed 'proper' fish and chips with peas fir N4,000 at Churchills bar in Lekki. Crust and Creme should change the menu description to Fish Goujons to avoid misleading other diners into a miserable  eating experience and costly mistake. They may want to Google fish and chips - they will not find what they served there and will give them an insight into customer expectations.More",40,August 2022,4.0
capetownluver,"Good food, bad service","The food tasted really nice. I ordered pasta carbonara and it was of a reasonable portion and price. However, the service is terrible. It took them forever to attend to us and to have us seated, despite the place not being that busy. They also...took so long to get the food out. Overall, I would recommend if you‚Äôre willing to wait but the food is nothing spectacular and personally, not worth the wait.More",45,December 2019,4.0
DoubleTCatering,Great Quiet Place For A Night Treat,"I love where I can have a good dessert late with good company. That seems easy. However, most places either fail with the quality of the product, the service, the ambiance, or the ease of access. C & C hit all the right notes. I...was able to walk in late, with my people, in a comfortable and well laid-out setting. I like that it's quiet as well. The layout helps make that happen.

The menu is pretty good, and with variety. Plus, you can get specialty cakes and ice cream from the counter up front.

Yes, it's on the high end, relatively speaking, so not somewhere I'd go day in day out. However, it's a good once in a fortnight (or date night) option.More",40,September 2019,4.0
thedrewfiles,Terrible Customer Service,"I have been to this location thrice on different ocassions. The first time was intentional for celebration purposes, while the second and third time, i had little or no choice because i was slightly stranded. However in all of my visits, despite the nice interior...and other effects, their food was way below average and the customer service personnels were either not enough or were too reluctant to serve. I will not recommend this location to anyone who is impatient or has high taste for customer service.More",40,April 2019,4.0

mamah2109,Yummilicious everyday treats!,"Have tried nearly everything on their menu from the breakfast to the pizzas and the salads. Great big servings of everything. The wait staff is friendly and polite but that could be because we are regulars!

ahmedaglan84,Delicious food with lot of varities,"Crust & Cream provides wide range of varieties including meat, chicken and seafood plats in addition to great dessert menu along with appetizers. I and my colleague tried only seafood plats and they are great, that include shrimps, salamon steak plats as well as seafood...pasta plats and shrimps Cesar salad.

I have three concerns about the restaurant

- We have visited the restaurant  2 times in same week and we noticed differences in quality and sizes of the dishes (e.g. shrimp size & count served in Cesar Salad and Pasta). We checked with the responsible and he told us there was a change in the Chief during this week which may make that happened.

- Spices provided in Seafood soap is terrible, change the taste and make it very bad.

- Toilets need to be improvedMore",40,December 2018,4.0

irishboy4,Breakfast,"Very good service but very limited breakfast menu. I‚Äôm vegetarian so did not want bacon, sausages or any other dead flesh. but got charged full price. So this made for a very high price of $14.60 for beans, 2eggs, 1 mushroom and half a small...tomato. I should have been able to order specific items. The eggs were very tasty btw.
