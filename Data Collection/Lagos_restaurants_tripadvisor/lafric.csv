SaintDalton,Splendiferous,"I'm actually impressed with this restaurant. 
Everything's just great or perfect or ok.
Highly recommended",40,August 2019,4.0
omohunola,Great food! Unimpressive service,"Food was reallyyyyy good but service was not that great. Went for lunch with a couple of friends. 3 people ordered for drinks and the waitress brought only one. 30mins later I called her to ask about our drink orders and she said she only...took one order and was coming back for the rest. She was really trying to be on top of her game but kept falling short. I believe they didn't have enough staff to cater because it was difficult to get a hold of our waitress at every point.
The food took forever to come! Thankfully she was courteous enough to update us when we asked. 5 people's food came and she went to attend to another table while the 6th plate was pending without any explanation. Let's just say the service was poor but the food made up for it. 
We ordered the l'afric special rice & fried rice, platter, kebab and rice+obe dindin. We all loved our food.
Oh and the portions are massive for a really good price. 
Would definitely go back, hopefully service is better!More",45,December 2018,4.0
Chinchin09,Real Pounded Yam,Great menu! I love the fact that this restaurant serves real pounded yam and not flour. My favorite meal is the Seafood Okro. I also love the white soup. Great lunch place! I also love this place for a budget weekend meal with my family....There’s something for the entire family including the little ones.More,35,October 2018,4.0
nubian1800,Lunch Time,"The food is good as I have tried various meals. However, service is poor and could get worse when the restaurant is full or very busy. Wait time for food can be 45mins or more. You have to struggle to get a waiters attention and...the waiters are generally not friendlyMore",40,November 2018,4.0
yogunrinola,"Seafood Okra, or Plain Okra?","Business meeting over lunch poses the dilemma of which to choose. Both are exceptionally good. Being that lunch time is ranked, plain okra it had to be. Which was just as well - it took an effort and a half to get off the chair...afterwards. When I grow up, I'm gonna poach this cook and keep him for myself!More",50,August 2018,4.0

Willy O,Great restaurant at Sanusi Fafunwa street,"My colleagues who had fed at L’Afric and were full of praise for the place invited me there for lunch. Being a skeptic, I grudgingly agreed. It meant driving from our office at Lekki Phase 1 to Victoria Island. 
As I stepped in I noticed...their very impressive layout of tables. As we struggled to pick a table one very polite waiter walked to us and asked if we wanted privacy or would rather enjoy enjoy a little noise. We chose to stay at the middle and enjoy a little noise as we equally wanted to banter with ourselves. 
I asked for fried rice and plantain as I wasn’t quite sure if their Nigerian dishes would be well made. My colleagues ordered Nigerian dishes. All the meals came out great and I quickly regretted not going local. But then, my rice was exceptionally tasty. It was truly adult dose in portion. As hard as I tried, I could not finish the meal. 
The waiters were generally polite, neat, and readily volunteered information and fresh ideas on what to combine with our main meal or drink.More",40,July 2018,4.0
485cheryla,Pretty good,The service was really fast. The seafood anything is the best. The seafood okra and seafood stew were delicious. I did not enjoy their egussi as much. The servers should learn how to smile. Their fresh juice is fantastic!! Music in the background was also...good. Wonderful place to take people to experience the best in Victoria Island for Nigerian food.More,40,June 2018,4.0
missdeola,"Good food, poor service.","L'Afric is a great place to get Nigerian meals. You'll like both the quantity and quality of your meals. Just don't hold your breath for good service. If you call to order, your food may be ready when you get there in 30 minutes or...you may have to wait another 30 minutes - nothing is guaranteed. They have a private members club, so those ones get good service. Members of the public are just there for good food if you don't know anyone.More",40,February 2018,4.0
melvin d a,"Everything tastes good, my all time favorite","This place is a referral. it has not disappointed yet.  i have dined here, breakfast, lunch and dinner.  is it possible for all items to be tasty? this might be as good as that claim gets.  the ambiance is great, the price is reasonable given...comparative menu prices for 
 other food establishments with non-matching tastes.  it is not just a go-to place. It is the Go-To place in Lagos. if you find a better diner, i'd like to go compare. the waiters are super-fast.More",40,March 2018,4.0
KBS39,"Food is SPECTACULAR, Service is POOR for large groups (6+)","Attended the 1st time with 2 brothers and the food came in a reasonable time frame and was absolutely delicious. The best I've had anywhere in Lagos.

So good that I went back with half my family (8/9 or us). This time around the food...took 1hr 20 mins to arrive and 6 out of 8 orders were wrong. The food was still amazing and they gave us a 10% discount as a goodwill gesture.More",40,January 2018,4.0
