NaijaBabe2016,Disappointing Sushi! 🍣👎🏽,"This is my second visit to Ocean Basket- (the V.I Akin Adesola branch). Was with my daughter this time around, so decided to try it again because she loves Seafood, and Ocean Basket is your one-stop-shop for great Seafood in Lagos. I won't get into...any details about the restaurant/menu, as I wrote an extensive review about it 5 months ago. It was an overall pleasant experience, with yummy Seafood and a nice ambiance. I wanted to try the Sushi at Ocean Basket on my maiden visit, but was told at mid-day that it wouldn't be available till after 3p.m, so I had to settle for their regular Seafood options.

This time around, Sushi was available, (thank heavens)! 🤲🏽 Not being too hungry, I ordered just 2 Sushi(s)- the PANKO SALMON FUTOMAKI and the PANKO PRAWN FLOWER GUNKANS, plus CRUMBED PRAWN TAILS (Served with Herb Mayonnaise) as my Starter. My daughter got the LEMON GARLIC MUSSELS or MUSSELS IN LEMON GARLIC SAUCE and CREAMY SEAFOOD PASTA. For her drink, she got a Mocktail called OCEAN BASKET SPECIAL. We were presented with 3 complimentary freshly baked Bread Rolls, served with 3 'mismatched' Sauces/Dips. The last time around, these Bread Rolls weren't fresh, but on this visit, they were hot, soft and fluffy! 😋

Both my Sushi(s) were a big letdown! First of all, the rice used wasn't the right kind, and just about every ingredient within the Sushi was tasteless and underseasoned. For the Flower Gunkans, I thought the actual Sushi would be wrapped in a sheet of Smoked Salmon. Yet, it was enveloped in a murky, pale, overly thick slice of pickled ginger! YUCK! 😫 It was too thick and pungent to be eaten, so I ended up unwrapping the ginger and discarding it entirely. The Futomaki Panko Salmon was decent, but perhaps because it was deep fried. Nevertheless, it lacked flavor. My Crumbed Prawn Tails were good, so crunchy, fleshy and fried perfectly. 

My daughter loved, loved, loved her Creamy Seafood Pasta. She said it's one of the best Pasta dishes she's ever had, and that they were super generous with the Seafood in it. For over 10 thousand naira....they better be! 😄 She also enjoyed her Ocean Basket Special Mocktail, but as for the Lemon Garlic Mussels, it was a different story. Though she said the sauce was delicious, the Mussels weren't cleaned properly, so the 'waste product' on them was still attached to the flesh. How gross! 🤮 Not knowing much about this type of shellfish, (as I don't like it)- I took her word for it. 

So this second experience at Ocean Basket ends up being a 'mixed bag'......a medicore mixed bag at best! Service is okay, albeit a bit slow. We had to urge them to speed it up a bit as we were in a hurry. Ocean Basket is still a place a would visit again, but I will most definitely avoid their Sushi. It is crystal clear that SUSHI IS NOT THEIR STRENGTH, so I'd politely urge customers visiting Ocean Basket to kindly avoid the Sushi here and go for the various types of Seafood on offer. Sending their employees to Sushi School won't hurt! 🍣 🍱 🏢

I rated Ocean Basket highly the first time I reviewed them, but this time around, it's going to have to be an average. The only thing that 'salvaged' the experience was the Fresh Bread, Crumbed Prawn Tails, the Lemon Garlic Sauce that accompanied the Mussels, and the Creamy Seafood Pasta of course. They should please endeavor to improve upon their Sushi, clean out the poop from their Mussels and speed up the service a tad bit. Regardless of the 'hiccups' this time around, Ocean Basket is still a wholesome, decent Seafood Joint that serves impressive Seafood, and I'd highly recommend it! 🍤 🧆 🦐 🐟 🦀 🐙 🦞More",40,August 2022,4.0
NaijaBabe2016,Impressive Seafood! 🍤 🦀 🐟 🦐,"I've been wanting to eat at Ocean Basket restaurant since I caught a glimpse of it while on a brief visit to Lagos last year. See I love, love, love me some seafood! 🦐🐟 🦀 😋 Besides, 'jewels of the sea & ocean' are few...and far between in a country like Nigeria; except if you happen to be in a port city like as Lagos. If I'm not mistaken, Ocean Basket is a South African chain of restaurants- with multiple branches in Africa, a few in Europe and one in the Middle East. I visited one of 3 branches in Lagos- (the Victoria Island one), and the restaurant was expansive, simple, bright and trendy. It was spread over 2 floors, plus a small outdoor/balcony area. Unfortunately they had a water leakage problem from the ceiling of the second floor on the day I visited, so I was seated in sort of a private room area upstairs. I had to bolt out of there fast because there was a French speaking family with small children that were super loud without consideration for anybody. Seriously, they seemed to be engaged in a shouting match! 🙉 I simply couldn't bear to sit there, so I was subsequently ushered downstairs. These folks were causing one hell of a commotion!!! 😫

Ocean Basket's menu is plentiful, without being too overwhelming. They had Starters & Meze, Salads, Platters (for one and to share), Fish, Prawns, Calamari, A Mediterranean Dish (Fritto Misto), Combos, Seafood Favorites, Ocean Basket Specials, Top Ups (sides), Sushi (plus Sushi Platters), Desserts (including Liquid Desserts) Mocktail Carafes, Beers, Ciders, Cold Coolers, Coffees/Teas and Cold Drinks. I wanted to order a Platter For One and Flower Gunkans Sushi , but was told that Sushi wouldn't be available till after 3p.m. I visited around noon. How disappointing that was, as their Sushi looked good from the pictures on the menu! 🍣 😋 Instead, I went for the NEPTUNE MEZE PLATTER (hake goujons, firecracker squid, calamari, crumbed prawn tails, battered zucchini, tomato, cucumber with 1,000 island, herb mayo and zesty mayo) from the Starters & Meze section. I also ordered an additional FAMOUS FISH & FISH (200gs of the all time favorite hake) cause I was famished. This meal would serve as my breakfast, lunch and dinner, as I was set to travel later that day. For my drink, I got the OCEAN BASKET SPECIAL, one of the mocktails on offer. For dessert, I ordered a CUSTARD TART (Pastéis De Nata)- a Portuguese Custard Tartlet. 

Overall, I have to say that I really enjoyed both my Neptune Meze Platter and the Fish & Chips. Both dishes were fried to crispy, golden perfection and presented impeccably; (refer to my posted pictures). The mocktail was very good too, as was the Custard Tart. However, the 'Pasteis De Nata' seemed to have fallen apart by the time it reached my table, so it looked a bit 'deconstructed'. Besides, it didn't taste fresh. I was served a complimentary bread basket with 3 weird dips, and 'unfresh' bread that had been over-warmed to the point of becoming as hard as a rock! Wish they had just passed on this. Service at Ocean Basket is excellent, from the friendly and polite demeanor of all the staff, to the Manager's warm reception. There was someone named WALE, (either the waiter who served me, or the Manager), can't quite seem to remember. I'd like to thank him for his kindness. The food was promptly delivered, and just about everything was on point. The ambiance of Ocean Basket is 'cool, calm & collected', and everything seems clean, orderly and well maintained.

 I was slightly let down by the fact that they couldn't 'tame' the boisterously loud family in the enclosed seating area I had initially sat down at. I wasn't the only guest who asked to leave that particular area. They were at least 2 sets of customers that came downstairs complaining about the ruckus they were causing! 😫 When I lamented about the noise, all they said was that they couldn't tell the family to keep it down because there was a language barrier, since they only spoke French! This is unacceptable, and came across as a weak, pathetic excuse not to keep rowdy customers in line. They need to take all their customer's 'feelings' into consideration, and not just one set of 'Francophone Loud-Mouths'! So all in all, I enjoyed my experience at Ocean Basket. This indeed is the 'Mediterranean Home of Seafood'- (just like it says under the title). The seafood is delicious, and I really look forward to returning and sampling many other dishes, especially their Sushi. It's your 'go-to-place' for fabulous Seafood in Lagos, and I highly, highly recommend it!!! 👏🏽👍🏽👏🏽👍🏽More",40,April 2022,4.0
