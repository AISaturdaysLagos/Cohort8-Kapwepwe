Francis N,Good old fashion authentic burger,"I went on 2 consecutive evenings over Christmas with family. The ambience is welcoming, though the dimmed lighting made reading the menu somewhat challenging (silly me forgot her glassesüôà). 
On the first day, I had a bacon single cheeseburger with cheesy fries. I could barely...taste the bacon, the actual burger patty was dry and tasted somewhat gamey, almost like it was made from goat meat... one of my fellow diners thought so too. The onions were raw rather than caramelised and the bread seemed a bit doughy. I ended up with indigestion and mild heartburn, and kept belching up a foul oily aftertaste... overall, I would not recommend this burger nor would I try it again. The saving grace was the cheesy fries which was really cheesy and soOoo yummy, I would order them again and the serving portion was generous too.
Sucker for punishment that I am, or maybe in the spirit of Christmas and keeping an open mind, I returned the next night as the children in the group insisted on Johnny Rockets. I knew I was going to have the cheesy chips for sure, but decided to try the Chicken club sandwich on wheat bread this time. The bread tasted stale and the salad in the sandwich was underdressed, the chicken was dry and stringy. As a personal choice, because I find it easier to manoeuvre, I prefer my sandwich cut into 4 and preferably without the crust. I did not enjoy this club sandwich. I had a coffee  milkshake which was full of flavour, rich, creamy and very moreish. I asked to speak to a manager,but was told there wasn‚Äôt one on site. I mentioned my concerns  to our server but he wasn‚Äôt particularly helpful, although, I guess if that‚Äôs the usual fare and no one else has mentioned these  and people like me despite the complaints keep coming back, then there‚Äôs no reason for him to be concerned.More",10,October 2018,4.0
