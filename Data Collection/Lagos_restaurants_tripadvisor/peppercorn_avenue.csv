Donald L,Fantastic Dinner at Peppercorn Avenue,"Five of us went for dinner, it could not have been better. All the food was fresh, tasty, perfectly spiced and reasonably priced. The highlights were the momos (steamed and fried chicken dumplings), the buttered chicken, the Thai red curry and the Nazi goreng. All...of us had a great meal in a relaxed atmosphere. Awesome!More",40,February 2019,4.5
244rameshd,Great food,"A very cosy place with maximum 30 to 35 seats but I must say, they have wonderful food. The momos were superb, their Indian delicacies were something to remember. The service is great and attentive. It doesn't look like it serves so many cuisines when...you enter the place. But go there and check out the variations of cuisines and the taste. You will be truly amazed. 

Will be back soon.More",50,August 2018,4.5
adey_naija,Thai with a Nigerian Twist,"Let me first say i liked this joint. it was cosy with attentive and friendly staff. They food is truly spicy (not peppery) and as the flavour is very rich and they have moderated it slightly to fit the typical Nigerian Palette.

Even when one...of the guys in the team ordered something wrongly because the menu wasn't clear, the manager made amends at no extra cost. Really friendly team.

Limited parking space at the restaurant but that is offset by generous road parking that is freeMore",40,July 2018,4.5

TukeMorgan,Thai Indian Fusion Restaurant,"Many people think restaurants in Lekki are nothing to write home about. Many of them aren't but some of them are. Peppercorn is a Fusion Restaurant which offers Indian & Thai Cuisine, I like the variety. The spring roll was oily and not great, the...complimentary indian crisps we got served at the beginning went nicely with sweet chilli sauce. The pan fried dumplings were better than the steamed one, I tried the pineapple fried rice, pad thai and different curries.

sindara,"I would visit again for the food, not the overall experience","First of all the AC here wasn’t working which is just tragic because Lagos is super hot; I couldn’t eat properly because I was so uncomfortable. 

On the other hand, the portion sizes were larger than I expected and 4 portions of naan were way...too much for 3 of us at dinner and I wish the waitress had specified that. The drinks were super expensive but their food was decently priced especially in relation to the portion sizes.More",30,May 2018,4.5

89ravig,Tasty and novelty Indian food.,"Decor
The  décor of the two gold Chinese Xiang warriors at the entrance and a wall of oriental pictures, rosewood furniture and subdued designer lighting,  gave the place a ethereal  feeling . I was curious about the clientele and the food at Peppercorn Avenue  The menu is...mix of oriental and Indian . We decided to go for Oriental

Food
We ended up having one starter and two main courses  The quality of the Kungpao Chicken we ordered as a starter  has really reached a level of excellence rivaling any 5 star Chinese.  The food was  excellent and really very reasonably priced for the level of skills involved.  We also ordered a Nasi Goreng, Singapore Chicken and Kuo Shuji. All cooked to perfection. We rounded off the lunch with Kulay Thod and crispy fried pineapple with ice cream 

What I loved about Pepper Corn Avenue is whether you want a more traditional take on Chinese or really eclectic regional Chinese dishes, you will find them both in this restaurant. Do ask for guidance from the staff who are very well trained and are able to guide people according to their taste buds. My advice when going to Pepper Corn is to try the more exotic sounding dishes rather than sticking to safe choices .

Desserts are excellent and the variety quite stunning for a Chinese restaurant.

Plus & Minus: Great quality of food. A little out of the way if you don’t live in and around Lekki, Victoria Island, Ikoyi. A visit might be extrmely refreshing and highly satisfactory.More",50,April 2018,4.5
