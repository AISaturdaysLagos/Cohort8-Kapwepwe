Ade2566,Quaint and Friendly,"Revisited this mainstay Cafe located on Akin Adesola Street in Victoria Island for a quick meeting with some potential clients.

Early morning at the Cafe presented a quiet and comfortable location for such meeting. Cafe was ran and staff greet you warmly on arrival. Coffee...and fresh pastries are available as expected. For those requiring a little bit more there is a light menu providing some good choices.

Some work still to be done in the delivery quality of service as our waitress served us our pastries in saucers rather than side plates.

Beyond this it was an overall OK experience much in line with what you would expect from a coffee shop.

Clean and comfortable with fresh pastries!More",50,September 2018,4.5

Lez M,Enjoyed a Sunday morning coffee here,"Went to look at the food products available in the store below, and was blown away by the amount of hard to find items that they had in the store.  They were a little pricey on some things and others they were reasonable.  We had...coffee and cake.  It was nice, but also pricey compared to other places we have visited.  But a lovely atmosphere and very clean and European in decor.   We will certainly be back.More",50,June 2018,4.5

princess_kaat,Dream Cafe,"Met with girlfriends at Delis on a recent trip to Lagos in Nigeria.

I would describe as a minimalist trendy cafe, great place to block out all the Lagos craze. Friends recommend it as a great place to work if the office just isn't cutting...it.

I had the Duo seafood salad which was absolutely delicious, calamari and prawns. Also the mocha frappe.More",40,July 2017,4.5
aboutsomethingelse,Just a drink but still impressed,"We stopped by just for a drink after visiting the grocery store below. Enjoyed (two) glasses of fresh pineapple juice and a strawberry smoothie. 

Even though our interaction with the staff was limited to drinks, we found them very friendly and attentive. The Cafe itself...is bright and airy with the huge windows facing the road and would be a great spot to catch your breath before or after grocery shopping. 

I look forward to coming back and trying their breakfasts especially.More",40,July 2017,4.5
Leke-Adeboye,My kids loved it....,"The handlers and waiters were just nice and accommodating. And that's not normal in Nigeria. Our food came on time and even when we asked for the steak to be recooked they obliged. 

You will love the mushroom sauce in anything you order. It was...really nice. I can't even say anything else. The toilet was also very clean. And that's a good sign for anywhere in Africa. Their smoothies also was just wonderfulnessMore",50,April 2017,4.5
