Ade703,Consistent over time,"Bungalow restaurant has been in existence for as long as I can remember and that's a remarkable feat (especially in this environment). The wear and tear of age shows a little bit on and in the building if you look closely enough but that's understandable....It's a mid-sized restaurant offering oriental cuisine and with about 3 or so different indoor sections (the bar, main restaurant area and then a smaller section where you can host private gatherings such as birthdays); there's also an outdoor sitting area though I hardly see this space used. Service can be a bit slow especially on busy days/nights e.g. weekends, the staff and manager are quite attentive and friendly - for me, this is always a big plus since I'm a sucker for good customer service. 

Overall it's a nice place for a night out with friends/family.More",40,March 2021,4.0
