Tia011,An ok place for a quick bite - nothing special,"An ok place for a quick bite. Some dishes are well made and quite tasty. I enjoyed the coconut rice, the first time I had it, when it was hot. The next time, it was lukewarm with a solitary prawn as a garnish! The food...could be much better if it was fresh and piping hot. I ordered an assortment of meat, it was tough and inedible. It is very variable in terms of quality, waiting staff are polite but seem inexperienced. 

Eating in is slightly better than ordering takeaway but the presentation is sloppy, oil dripping from containers and cold food. All in all, an average place.More",40,March 2020,4.0
