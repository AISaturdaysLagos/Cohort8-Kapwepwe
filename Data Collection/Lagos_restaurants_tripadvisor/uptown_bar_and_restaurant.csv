drpolitick,The BEST Sushi in Africa,"Wow. Where to begin? The service is fast and friendly. The restaurant, on the top floor of the hotel is clean and well designed with views of all of Eko-Atlantic from your seat. While it wasn't cheap, every single thing I and my friends had...was delicious. From the bread to the pasta, the steak to the salads, you can't go wrong on the menu. But what amazed me was the sushi - the best I've had anywhere in Africa. Apparently they get it flown in fresh every week. I was very impressed and will certainly be returning on my next visit to Lagos.More",45,Apr-17,4,Uptown Bar and Restaurant
PatrickA3159,An average restaurant with a great view,"The view is very nice from the restaurant but pity that the food is not up to the expectation.

The fish and chips I ordered was very oily and tasteless.

This restaurant needs to work on his menu and the quality of his food.",40,Nov-16,4,Uptown Bar and Restaurant
Tourunlimited,Friendly service and good view,I stayed at the hotel for 5 days and almost everyday had my dinner at this place.  The staff was friendly and their service was prompt.  The chef is a great guy and made the dining experience more enjoyable. I would highly recommend it.   Being...located on the 7th floor also gives a good sunset view.More,40,Dec-16,4,Uptown Bar and Restaurant
Theo K,Overpriced and smokey,The food and service here were quite good. The restaurant is neat and has a good look and feel to it. There are two issues here: The first is the price of food which is more expensive than a decent restaurant in the States and...secondly they allow patrons to smoke inside. Would you care for some secondhand smoke with your steak?More,50,Mar-16,4,Uptown Bar and Restaurant
