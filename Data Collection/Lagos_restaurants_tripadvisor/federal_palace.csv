TheLuckyTraveller14,Worst Pizza Ever,"The hotel is great, beautifull & clean, the service is professional but the Pizza is the worst ever.
The corners hard as hell the middle uncooked, what a shame for this kind of place.
On top of that they charge you parking money what is...unacceptable for a place as this, with unfriendly arrogant gate keeper.
I had a stamp of the consierge so I didn’t need to pay, but they tried to ask money anyway! I didn’t pay afterall but lost 15mins for nothing!More",40,February 2020,4.0

cyrilfure,Nice food.,The food is really nice. Probably one of the best in Lagos. Best advice is to go for the buffet. Price is reasonable.,40,July 2018,4.0
Gr1970Gr,"Compared to other premium hotels, it’s OK","Probably one of the better hotels in Lagos, but with the reception filled with cigarette smoke from the casino, not a great reception. The hotel is clean, breakfast was fine and the rooms are comfortable. The room I stayed in had been renovated, but they...neglected to renovate the bathroom fully. Some old taps which was a detractor.More",35,June 2018,4.0

Rissik,A most memorable Dinner,"I decided to host the 612th Apapa Diners Dinner at Federal Palace on Thursday 26 April 3018. It was a special dinner for both me personally and the Apapa Diners Club. It would be the start of my 60th Birthday celebrations and 51 years of...continuous monthly dinners for the Apapa Diners Club.  

The General Manager David Kliegl together with the Executive Chef  Dietmar Faes and the Food and Beverage Manager George Dairy planned and delivered a superb six course menu accompanied by an interesting variety of canapés and a excellent choice of Champagne, wines and Port. 

My gratitude to David and his team for ensuring that all aspects of the dinner was a complete success and this was backed up by the compliments I received from the other  diners. 

I will most certainly use Federal Palace for my next dinner or any other event I will be hosting or organizing.More",50,April 2018,4.0

MIssB26,"Awesome Hotel, Awesome service","I have been staying at the Federal Palace for some 5 years now. Every time I stay there I am welcomed back ""home"" and that is just what it feels like. 

From the gracious host, GM Mr David Kliegl to Mr Anthony Ajayi, Rooms Division...Manager to Mrs Zulay Omorelo, their attention to detail is amazing. 

The rooms are spacious, well serviced with shampoos, creams etc and the rooms are spotless. There is a coffee making machine, a kettle, a fridge and room service has great meals. The daily lunch buffet is a must too!! 

I look forward to returning in November when I know I will be ""coming home"" again.More",30,September 2017,4.0

Ianfung,LOW QUALITY BUFFET,1st day at the FPH and decided to stay in and checked out their buffet. They have 2 sections: local Nigerian and International food + usual starters and dessert.
