Kelly M,"Yes, yummy.","We were a group of about 12 people and I always wonder how the wait staff handles large groups. This restaurant's wait staff seemed to know what to do, and although some individuals got their pizza a bit after others, it was all ok.  The...pizzas are very good, with plenty of toppings spread all over the pizza.  Cooked in a wood stove is extra special too. Thank you also for Heineken draft. I'll definitely visit again. p.s. the only 'negative' thing was the children beggars when we left. I ended up giving a child my leftovers/1/2 pizza, and the uber driver said the children won't eat it, but they will sell it and/or giving it to the 'beggar owner'.......I didn't feel about that. Now I know for next time.More",40,Sep-21,4,Pizze-riah
