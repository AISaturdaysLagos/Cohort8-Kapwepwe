iedokpayi,Well enjoyed,"I visited Nigeria in December 2021. Wanted a hang out place with live music. I googled and this place came up. So i went with my partner. No regrets. Cosy environment. The place is big enough to pick the best and most convenient spot for...you to sit. Very clean place including toilets. Live music was good. We had lobster and jollof which tasted great. We felt safe while in the place. The service from the waitresses was superb. The next time i visit Lagos, i will be visiting the bar. Kudos.More",40,December 2021,4.0
TaofickO,Favourite Hangout Spot,"I have patronised EBar for quite a number of years. It’s a good central spot in Lekki phase 1, it’s convenient for catching up with friends and drinks/food quite reasonably priced and good portions. 
They have various nights for different activities which includes Jazz night...on Thursdays, live bands on Fridays etc. The patrons cut across Nigerians and expats. 
The staff are nice and friendly. I prefer the outside as its open space and casual. There’s a pool table inside and other activities. 
It’s a nice down to earth place and will continue to patronise the establishmentMore",45,August 2018,4.0
Keithedwin,Great Bar & Restaurant/Cafe on Admiralty Way.,"E Bar is something of an institution, especially with the expats in Lekki. Service is very good and ditto for security. Friday is BBQ night but their menu is pretty good Nigerian dishes.

Music is pretty current and mainly local.",45,October 2017,4.0

babyrock246,Dark and seedy but passable food,"Not my usual cup of tea but I had to meet up with a friend there..it's dark perhaps suited for men who want to indulge in male bonding than couples or family .
I was there in the afternoon so it was a bit empty.picture...attached is from my spot at the window.
The chicken salad was good ..my friend was in raptures over the chilli prawns he is a picky eater so I take his word for it .
Not my idea of a chill spot but we all have different tastes..More",40,July 2015,4.0

Ibadanboy,Hang out joint,"E-Bar is a restaurant/ bar/ hang out joint located on Admiralty Way in Lekki Phase 1, Lagos. It has both inside & outside seating space and large flat screen TVs showing sports. There was live music when I went and the band was playing excellent...covers of great jazz & soul songs. Service was OK, but not impressive. Our server was friendly and pleasant enough. Te ambience was nice - not too crowded and music not too loud. The decor is fair outside (I did not go inside) and all in all, I found that this place is a decent option for a drink on a weekend evening.More",40,February 2015,4.0

Stephen P,Noise and poor service,The noise level in the building started off at a level where you did not require hearing protection but this soon changed to very loud noise which someone described as music. The service was poor and to get a drink or something to eat almost...impossible. This I assumed was due to the fact that nobody can hear anything you shout.More,40,January 2013,4.0
