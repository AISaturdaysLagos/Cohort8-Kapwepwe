Fiyin O,Lunch at the Breeze beach club,"Breeze is a very exclusive and remarkable beach club. You are transcended from hustle and bustle of Lagos to this serene and aesthetically pleasing location. You are welcomed by the amazing hosts who are very polite and friendly. The customer service was exceptional. Our waitress...Vanessa was very well trained, conversant and knowledgeable about the food and drinks menu, she made some very good recommendations based on what we told her about our dietary preferences. Throughout our stay she kept checking in on us to make sure everything was up to the standard we expected. As day turned into night, the scenes became even more beautiful and the vibes were unmatched. If I was to make a comparison, the closest comparison would be like some beach clubs in Santorini, Mykonos or South of France. Definitely one to make sure you visit and gain membership. You will not be disappointedMore",50,Nov-23,5,Breeze Beach Club
