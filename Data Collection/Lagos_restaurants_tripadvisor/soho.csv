Roger C,Best Chinese Restaurant in Town,Have tried many Chinese restaurants in Nigeria. This is no doubt the best. Especially with Chef Chua's personal touch and signature dishes. Every dish is exceptionally good. You can feel the efforts the Chef has invested. Very authentic. Highly recommend it!,45,April 2021,4.0

niiamahd,Slow Service But Lovely Setting,Wasn't impressed with the service from last night's service level at the business dinner we had here. The food took over an hour to come. Previous visits were quick. The food was good though.,50,January 2017,4.0
271alistaird,"Ok food, poor service","Visited for a dinner, in a group of 4. The restaurant was less than a third full but the service was incredibly slow, inattentive and inaccurate (orders mixed up and at least one main dish was forgotten and then appeared after everything else had been...eaten). The food itself was ok, but no better than that. Not everything was available (e.g. No duck, no lamb) but I understand that the circumstances are not fantastic and so it's not fair to compare with London, for example. But I was disappointed by the service, which is one thing that the restaurant could control and make sure it gets right. It took us 2 hours to order and eat 2 courses. Next time I'll go to the buffet downstairs!More",50,December 2016,4.0

KapilV611,Inflated prices with average service and limited options,"Roof for half of the place was leaking when we went. Food is average, service is average and prices are high. Enjoy at your own risk",30,March 2015,4.0
Segaria226,Ok Chinese in Intercontinental Hotel,"Soho is located in the intercontinental and consequently is a reasonably expensive place. The food quality was average for a Chinese in my view and the wine was incredibly expensive for pretty average stuff (standard basic spanish wine at over Â£30 a bottle - the...naira would have to keep falling for while to make the price even vaguely good value). 

The restaurant is rather dark - too dark in my view and the service was pretty slow.More",20,January 2015,4.0
IvanS2,The best Chinese restaurant,"I visited Soho for dinner buffet twice this month.They have good Chinese  food options and noodles, and my favourite is their Tom yam soup.This place is worth trying.",40,,4.0
globetravell,Very Good Chinese ...and Veg TOO,"This is a restaurent within Intercontinental Lagos. I took an opportunity to dine at this place over the weekend. I being a pure vegeterian, knew that I will not have much options to eat and was true when i looked at the menu card selection....However the restaurent staff, was so good to and made some recommendations to me which can be done in vegeterian. They also called the Chef to talk to me and make sure they prepare something which is pure vegeterian and as per my taste. Trust me....when i saw the protion of meal..i felt its too much for me to eat, but when i started....i managed to clean the entire portion they had served and managed some dessert too.

This place is worth trying, epecially for the hospitality of the Hotel Staff.More",50,April 2014,4.0
