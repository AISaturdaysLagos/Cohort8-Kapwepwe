411Hemaa,Breeze the beach club to be at â€¦.,"This space is amazing what can I say !! Members only so thatâ€™s perfect no funky crowd , perfect for families or friends.

Food is so different from what you get in Lagos , very Mediterranean style and a lot of seafood options considering its...a beach club 

The pool is mad ðŸ¤ª I felt like I was in Mykonos â€¦. This place is definitely worth the membership and hype a good investment .More",40,August 2023,4.0

Mooncake1969,Friday nights BBQ is amazing with a spit roasted goat,"came to dine last Friday night at the relaunch of their BBQ evening.
The place was packed, As well as a great BBQ which was cooked live by Chef Maroun and his team. Assorted seafood and meat were available. even crocodile was on the menu,...however the highlight for me was a freshly spit roasted goat which tasted amazing. They also had a selection of Nigerian dishes along side a salad buffet.
Their pastry chef had a great spread of desserts and freshly baked bread on offer.
Great ambiance and we will definitetly be here again soonMore",40,August 2015,4.0
