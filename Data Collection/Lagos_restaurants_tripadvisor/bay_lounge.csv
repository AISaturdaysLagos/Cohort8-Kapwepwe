G6887MNchristinem,Loved the live band,Nice open air place. We went on a Saturday night and enjoyed the live music. Food and drinks were reasonably priced for Lagos. Food was nothing special but I really enjoyed the environment by the water. Waiters were pleasant.,40,October 2022,4.0
sue_4192,Hangout,"SLOW SERVICE!!!! meal is ok tho, but the service was so damn slow it made me really dislike the place. They should work better of prompt customer service ..",40,August 2020,4.0
Ade703,Excellent outdoor chill spot,"Bay Lounge is a great place for a relaxing evening outdoors, an added bonus is the prices are also quite reasonable. It's mainly made up of a very large outdoor sitting area with one section facing the lagos lagoon. There's sometimes a live band performing...and other times, just a DJ. The food and drinks are good and you can go there either well or casually dressed. It's more alive in the evenings / nighttime though there open from the afternoon downwards I think. 

The place is a winner anytimeMore",35,December 2019,4.0

523Sadcustomer523,First Time. Bad Grill,"My first hang out time and it was a mix of good and bad. So the bad first. The grill fish, cat fish I ordered was not well made. Doubt the fish is good itself as it lacked all taste of freshness, seasoning etc. Music...was good. Nice dj. Ambience good as well as I sat close to the waters. A gentleman, I supposed he was the manager on duty just randomly came to my table to ask if all is well. While he was genuine in his effort there was no effort to make it good even when he saw the abandoned fish on my table. Perhaps what drew him in the first instance. The owners should get some good bbq guys and order fresh fish daily.More",40,August 2019,4.0
JulesLove,Favourite hangout!,"This wonderful restaurant is located at the waterfront in Lekki Phase 1. I am always happy to be by the waterside, especially in an outdoor venue like this one. 

The staff was friendly and attentive and we didn't wait long for our food. We had...the yummiest pepper soup and jumbo prawns with garlic sauce!

In the early evenings there's a great dj playing the latest tracks mixed with classics. Some evenings of the week there's a live band playing. Unfortunately they didn't start playing until 10 pm. I wished that they would have started a bit earlier in the evening, so we would have been able to enjoy them longer. 

We came to this restaurant twice during our 2 week stay in Lagos as it immediately became on of our favourite spots!More",30,January 2019,4.0
dutchgabon,Steak without a steak knife,"Very neat, clean space but no sun shades so avoid afternoon. Came in late afternoon. DJ was setting up his equipment and had nice music on. I had some chicken, marinated in a sweet sauce. Was absolutely great. Beer was very cold. Mrs had a...steak and a struggle since they had no steak knives. Overall very good value for your money. Not the prices you normally expect in LagosMore",50,December 2018,4.0
Ade2566,Casual Open Air Dining & Entertainment,"Bay lounge is a casual dining restaurant with an open air setting. While there is a covered seating option the fun and energy of Bay Lounge is best felt on the outside. Here on most nights from Wednesday through Saturday there is either a band...on stage (real stage) or comedy (Thursdays and Fridays). No booking is required but it does get busy and choice seats (lounge style) go quick.
Food is varied and most people can find something from local to continental dishes. For Vegetarians you will do well to ask what can be provided or create your own mix and march from the menu.
Bay lounge seats 3 doors away from Sailors lounge also another popular restaurant and open air dining.

Best kept secret on the menu is the Tiger prawns and garlic sauce. It's by far the best value by price and weight on the island and quite delicious too!  

Full bar with cocktails and drinks are moderately priced allowing for a fun night out easy on the wallet. Enjoy!More",50,October 2018,4.0

2debia,A nice place to relax,"My first visit was brief as we called in on the way back from an outing. Really nice setting with plenty of space between tables which makes a change. A little expensive but is prime location and only to be expected. Table service was friendly...and efficient. We ordered food, mine with request of no pepper... But so peppery hot I couldn't eat it.
With the sea breezes, can get colder at night so take something warm along in case you need it. Hope to revisit.More",40,August 2018,4.0

ibikunleo,Must visit on a Friday night,"Friday nights at Bay Lounge are very enjoyable. There is usually a live band, a very good live band. The only drawback is that being an open air it is also at the mercy of the weather.
