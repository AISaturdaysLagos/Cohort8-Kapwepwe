emmanuels0nm,"Mr Emmanuel, Checking out THE HOUSE Lagos","So I have been hearing lots about ""THE HOUSE"" and it's great! Service and ambient, then I decided to go look myself and boom!!! It was an amazing experience, they treated me like a rockstar or like a president in a foreign country, the experience...was second to none, the food was fascinating, the place they took me to is called the parlor, but the white room is dope!, It's just AMAZING!, A lot to talk about, but you can check it out yourself.More",40,Sep-21,4,The House

ajibolap2021,Mr Ajibola,"Fantastic place to be. Service was great. 

Waitstaff are knowledgeable and friendly.

Food was excellent. They also have different 

rooms with vibes that makes you stay longer. 

Their private rooms are comfortable 

and unique. 

I recommend THE HOUSE as the best place to 

dine, hang...out and socializeMore",35,Oct-21,4,The House
ogribim,Mr Michael,It's been excellent experience all the way. The service is one of the best in the travel industry so far.,50,Oct-21,4,The House
gbenga10000,Best in town!!!,"THE HOUSE is unarguably the best Social House in Lagos. A restaurant, bar, lounge, courtyard all under one roof! 

I was there with a couple of friends in August and we all had the best time ever! The food is second to none. The ambience...appeals to everyone. Whatever you‚Äôre in the mood for, there‚Äôs a space to accommodate your needs. 

I highly recommend a visit.More",50,Aug-21,4,The House
wilxmm,The Ambience was superb,"Overall great experience. From the lighting to the decor, the food, and the staff, it was a very pleasing experience.

I would recommend their private spaces. it suits the name of the restaurant and offers an exclusive feel to dining out with family and friends....100% recommend.More",40,Oct-21,4,The House
omohunola,"Tasty food, lovely ambience","Loved the setup of the various spaces. 
Sat in the living room and the ambience was just right. 
Service was a little slow but the waiter was apologetic. 
Starter snail and garlic bread could have been great if the bread actually tasted like garlic bread....Jerk chicken meal was amazing, even the coconut rice was tasty alone.
Spare ribs was juicy and tender! 
The prices were worth it too! 
I'll definitely go againMore",50,Sep-21,4,The House
Zoe M,Awful customer service.,Me and my husband visited The House two nights ago. We sat down and many staff saw us sitting down but no one came and took our drink order for over 20 mins and then I kept asking various staff members if we could order...food and they kept saying they would send someone to take our order and no one came I then had to go up to a lady and ask for the 4th time if I could order food and she came and took my order by this time over 40 minutes had past. I ordered the jerk chicken and having been to Jamaica several times and being from London can confirm it tasted nothing like jerk chicken!! I was served my meal on a wooded chopping board on top of a banana leaf and given a tiny plate to eat off of. It was very awkward eating chicken and rice of a tiny plate like that. The waitress told me the food came with a jerk sauce but the sauce wasn‚Äôt jerk sauce more of a pepper sauce. My food was cold and as the waitress put my food down she rushed off as I asked her if we could order more drinks and never heard me. No one came to ask if the food was okay. I had to go and find someone to ask if I could order more drinks even tho it was clearly visible our glasses was empty and I was left there eating a meal without a drink. We was charged for alcohol even tho my husband asked for a daqarai without any alcohol. The Shisha was alright. All in all the place is over priced and the customer service is terrible. The jerk chicken ain‚Äôt jerk chicken.More,50,Jan-21,4,The House
aadedayo,Best !!!!,"My go to spot for Ofada Rice. They never disappoint me when it comes to its food. Also a lovely chill spot to hangout. 
Dunno how they do it but they shouldn‚Äôt stop doing what they are doing.",50,Mar-20,4,The House
Travlash,"Great ambience, nice staff, terrible service","In summary, I came, sat for 49 mins and left without eating or drinking anything.

I'm not one to leave a negative review but this took the biscuit. After reading the reviews here, I thought this would be a great place to eat, drink and...relax. I even invited a few friends to join me after work.

The place had no signage so when the driver dropped me off, he had to check we were in the right place. I thought 'awesome, I love the mystery!' I came in, and was shown my seat (the kind guy at reception helped me charge my phone). 

I sat and after 15mins of no service, I went to reception to remind them I was here, waiting and hungry, and they said I'd be sorted soon. I went back to sit. Another 15mins passed and then I started to really wonder. 

A couple that came in after me yelled to one of the waiters to be served and after some apology, they brought them a menu. I was alone, not one for shouting so I waited. Looked at my clock. Waited another 15minutes.

I was given no drinks menu not to talk of ordering drinks or food. I wondered how I would get back to my hotel 20mins away but I thought I'd rather faint than spend any time there. I got up and walked to the door. 

The receptionists asked if I had a nice time. I couldn't help but laugh. I told them no (with a smile), I had got no service and I was going to find food anywhere that would serve me. They handed me my phone and I said I'd come back a different day maybe. Of course I won't be back. No one has time to wait around to spend their own money.More",40,Dec-19,4,The House
timihamilton,Dope spot. 9/10 recommend,"Dope spot. 9/10 recommend, especially their events and weekends too! 

Favorite place to stay in is their outdoor area, The Courtyard.",40,Dec-19,4,The House
Tope J,Lunchtime,"Cosy place with serene environment. Ambience is nice. You can either eat outdoors or for more privacy eat indoors. Food menu is good enough with good starter, main and dessert choices.  Prices are bit above average but you won't break the bank. Overall a nice...place to have eat and relax.More",10,Oct-19,4,The House
523Sadcustomer523,The Place for a cool date,"I was looking for a place to chill out with a friend and have some discussions. Eventually, we settled for this lovely place. At first i had my reservation with their seeming variants of areas to sit and dine and have fun. But on entering...the concerns vanished. The outside seating area was cool but we ended up on the balcony ( ideal if you are not a bad boy out with a date you cant be seen with ...lol). The white room was cool as well but i dont smoke shisha. Food was great ( sea food pasta) and their service was excellent. The waiters were courteous. if you take a date here and not impressed, please do more dates with her..she will be hard to please.More",50,Aug-19,4,The House
Damidj,Great food in a cozy atmosphere,"The House delivers on it food all the time. I always want to ask for the chef everytime I have a meal here, because I always leave so satisfied. I have been here a few times, one of which was to celebrate a birthday with...friends. And so far have not been disappointed. 
The restaurant is located in the VI annex part of town, so is accessible off Ajose Adeogun. If you're not familiar with that part of town, Google maps should be your friend. 
It is literally located in a house that has barely been converted. So the concept is different rooms, depending on what you are in the mood for. The living room is the general dining room, and then there are offshoots on the ground floor and upstairs, such as the white room, the party room, the cigar room, etc. It doesn't feel like you are in someone's house, but it certainly feels cozy and could work well as a members only clubhouse concept. 
It is a great location for a date, informal business meeting, catch-up with friends, or even small parties in one of the private rooms. 
Back to the food, I've tried many things off the starter menu and my most recent meal was the buttermilk chicken burger with a side of sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries (pictures in the photos below) were the most healthiest portion sizes I think I have ever had. They were huge. And the buttermilk burger was the juiciest chicken burger I've had. I'm quite pleased with the food delivery here and it's always a good choice when I'm in the mood for a laid-back vibe.More",20,May-19,4,The House
Lola S,"Great food, chilled atmosphere","You may drive past it as there isn‚Äôt any signage On the outside - it looks like another house on the street. 
The food was amazing, large portions and  reasonably priced compared to some places in Lagos. 
Staff are friendly and polite with good customer...More",40,Dec-18,4,The House

lizzielicious,Depends on when you go,This is one of those places that you visit and can either have a very good experience with the service or you have an extremely bad one. There's no in between! I've been here severally and I've had nice dinners and not so nice dinners....More,40,Jul-18,4,The House
431adakua,Cozy ambience & delicious cuisine,"The house gives all the comfort of home in ‚Äúthe living room‚Äù while spontaneously giving you the outdoorsy vibes.

The duvets and couches were so much comfort. Meat platter was divine! The ‚Äúhouse party‚Äù (signature drink) was a party indeed. 

Highly recommended!",50,Jul-18,4,The House
missdeola,Hidden gem,"There are different rooms for almost any occassion, a garden and they have a mini-library. It really feels like a house. And the service is so great, it'll have you wondering if you're still in Nigeria. Their cocktails were also good. Would definitely visit again.",30,Jun-18,4,The House
