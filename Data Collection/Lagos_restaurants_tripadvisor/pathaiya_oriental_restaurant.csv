ChikaLadybug,All the entrees tasted the same,"The service was slow.  I eventually walked up to the bar from my table to ask for a bottle of water. The food when it arrived was ok, but as a plate of vegetables goes I've eaten better. It contained lots of additives so I...had trouble sleeping that night. Parking was extremely difficult, with only around 5 spaces directly in front of the restaurant. The road is unlit so quite dangerous to walk across if you have to park outside. There are also large pot holes scattered about. The plus side was that the gate guard was very polite and helpful.More",30,Feb-17,3.5,Pathaiya Oriental Restaurant
