Leosquests,My New Go to Spot...,"Lydia's Place is a nice cosy restaurant which caters local Nigeria dishes from Rice, Pasta, a range of soups and staple,etc. They also have private lounges.
The first time i ate here, i ordered the Seafood Okro with Poundo Yam, and i was sold! It...was soo nice and even though i was filled up i had to request a take home pack! yes it was that good.
Great value for money as the portions are large, reasonably priced and service is pleasant,

Down side is the wait period; it took so long....  so be prepared to wait awhile, although i discovered you can make a call to place your order befor your arrival and this cuts the wait time almost by half. Also parking can be abit of an issue especially Friday evenings (but then again so is almost every hangout spot in Lagos) so you may have to park outside and pay a tip.
I would most definately recommend to anyone who loves good Nigerian foodMore",35,April 2017,4.0

i u,Scam,I was in town and took my friend Chika out to lunch after a business meeting. I ordered Editan soup and she ordered Afang. It took an hour plus to get the food out and the waitress was not too friendly and never smiled. Anyway...the scam here was that I got Edikaikong soup instead of Editan which I ordered and my friend got Editan when she ordered Afang. Chika didn't know the difference but I did because I'm from Akwa Ibom and very familiar with our native soups. I didn't bother to have it corrected coz that would have been another 1 hour wait.More,50,July 2016,4.0

ayoawejoseph,Lovely African Restaurant,Lovely African restaurant with nice meeting rooms. The sea food okra is a toast meal of the restaurant and always on point.,20,May 2016,4.0
AdioB,Disappointing Meal,"This restaurant has the potential of being a cozy place to eat local dishes with its neat interior decor, and air conditioning, but service is very slow, you may have to wait as much as 30 minutes. So if you must go, don't go hungry....When they meal finally came, the vegetables was near raw and the meat was tough. My partner's meal was alright so perhaps the cook was having mood swings. They also do not have a functioning card payment system. Parking spaces are narrow so you are better off parking outside. Be careful of the waiters, they made a mistake on my bill and eventually apologized.More",50,December 2015,4.0
523Sadcustomer523,A real Treat,"First time I was eating from Lydia was a jollof rice with prawns. I thought it was wow. Slightly better than yello chili, I thought. Then, after a long while I wanted to go for a native treat and to Lydia I went. My friend...encouraged me to try the okra with seafood. I LOVE IT. I was so craving it, I ordered the next week when the appetite for 'swallo', Nigerian nickname for local solid food. Do we have light food anyways. Cool simple ambience as well. Food feels freshMore",40,November 2015,4.0

Y6571FYandyc,For Nigerian Food Lovers A Real Treat!,"Tucked away in Victoria Island lies Lydia's Place. It's a nice and well thought out space. Downstairs it looks like a traditional restaurant while upstairs are the lounges including private rooms. The menu is typically Nigerian - a wide range of 'soups' including Egusi, Okro,...Banga and Oha to name but a few along with rice dishes and the predictable range of additions such as beef, chicken, goat meat, snail, seafood and fish. In passing, in a country which typically overlooks beef to ridiculous extremes, it is a plus that Lydia's produce beef far more palatable to a European palate. The food is cooked fresh and there are positives and negatives attached to this. The positives include the diner being able to regulate the heat of the spices - my friend likes ""mild"" while I prefer ""hot hot""! It also ensures a good quality to the final product. The downside however is that you can expect to wait 45-60 minutes for your food (but it's worth waiting for). My tip is on the first visit get a take away menu and then on subsequent trips phone your order through 30 minutes before you arrive and then your food will be with you giving you enough time to first enjoy a drink. The staff are friendly and attentive and the value for money is good - you can expect to pay around N3,500 (£14 or $22) per head for portions large enough to eat half and take the rest home. Be warned that there is the occasional karaoke night which attracts volunteers of varying talent. My one main criticism is that they need to sort out the water and drying facilities in the rest room. Overall a positive experience if you like Nigerian food.More",30,October 2013,4.0
