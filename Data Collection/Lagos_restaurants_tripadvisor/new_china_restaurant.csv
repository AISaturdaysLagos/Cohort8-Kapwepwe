Good portion sizes, well priced and a good range on the menu.
Staff are friendly and despite the exterior of the building, the interior looked clean and well furnished.",30,Apr-17,4,New China Restaurant
renaypan,Overpriced but tasty,"This restaurant is practically next door to the Sheraton, so definitely one of the few places within walking distance to eat.  Locals seem to like the place, as it was very crowded when we were there.  Reminded our group of overpriced ""Panda Express"" food.",40,Feb-17,4,New China Restaurant
Ian L,Arguably the best Chinese food in town,"My family has been frequenting New China Restaurant consisting for the past decade and a half. Having tried most of the Chinese restaurants in Lagos, New China stands out for its food quality. Consistently awesome, the chefs rarely disappoint. May not have the views or...ambience of some of the more ""fancier"" places, but the décor is tasteful and the atmosphere is classy in a subtle and subdued way. Service is great too.More",30,Feb-17,4,New China Restaurant
Chizoba O,Quite pricey but good enough.,"My second time of going to New China restaurant after so many years. I had the steamed prawns Dumpling (N2800 for 4 pieces), Seafood soup with bean curd (N1700), Steamed rice (N1600 for a bowl) and Fish with broccoli on hot plate (N6700) and chapman...(N1200). Their prices are quite steep I must say. Their food was good though their dumpling wrap was a bit doughy. Not the clear white and thin texture you get from Chopsticks Chinese Restaurant (Ikeja) or Jade's Palace (V/I). I was surprised to see how busy it was that Sunday afternoon considering that the restaurant is located at the basement and the sign outside the building is almost invincible. Service was courteous too. A big minus for me: I was served the ordinary rice instead of the basmati variety Chinese restaurants use and it wasn't even salted. I expected to get more salted flavoring from the fish sauce but it seems the restaurant is afraid of salting their food. For such a steep price I expected better. The only meal I enjoyed was the seafood soup. A good enough place to take your family or friends to if you've got the money to burn.More",50,Feb-17,4,New China Restaurant
