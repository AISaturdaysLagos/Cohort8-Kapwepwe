timetraveller64,Nice ambiance and great steaks,"I had dinner with an old colleague here at this nice restaurant in Victoria. I arrived early (unusual for Lagos) so had a drink in the bar first, very competent bartender. 
 
We both had steak with nice sides including mushroom and spinach and shared a...good bottle of red wine.

foodieforevermore,Falling Standards,"The standards at The Grill by Delis continue to slip. 

What opened up as a chic addition to the fast-growing Island restaurant scene, with a guarantee of a fine dining experience,  has over the last 7 months, declined into an intelligence-deficient establishment  where diffident waiters...make respectful (if curious) enquiries on whether guests  ‚Äòwould like some groundnut‚Äô, as they endure the long wait-times for your meal. Groundnut?. Oh dear. 

For the lucky few who have established ‚Äòfriendships‚Äô with some waiting staff, one singular roll of bread (often very lonely in the fetching silver bread basket) may be offered to you. Should you dare ask for another roll, you may notice your waiter physically stiffen at your audaciousness. The poor man is probably thinking about how to justify such a request to the kitchen staff. 

Getting proper butter for the lonely bread roll, has also become something of a lottery too; some days you may get a cut out from a giant slab that sits in the kitchen, and on other days you‚Äôll be treated to fine little individual pots straight from France. 

Although prices have remained the same since the Restaurant opened about 18 months ago, portion sizes have generally dwindled in direct partition to the establishments glory. 

Permit me to share a case-study on the  aubergine and mozzarella bake. 

This indulgent starter started off being served as 9 slices of an average-sized aubergine, beautifully plated in 3 stately towers and generously drizzled with pungent pesto. 

Over time, the average-sized aubergine got replaced with its dwarf-sized relation, looking very scant indeed when presented as 3 coin sized piles, in the middle of a suddenly oversized plate. 

And then somewhere along the line it happened.... the 3 dwarf piles were reduced to two. Shots fired. 

But we managed. Because we are in Nigeria and managing is what we do. 

Long-suffering and endurance are traits that our colonial masters programmed us for, and our ‚Äòmanaging‚Äô culture has been ingrained and reinforced by generations of self-serving leaders. 

But our pop-culture hero‚Äôs of the day have been pushing us in a different direction. These role models to a youth population long forgotten by the government, have been preaching that we must ‚Äòshine our eye‚Äô. So I got out my polish as I returned to The Grill yesterday for my favourite, if grossly over-priced,  aubergine bake. 

With my freshly polished contact-lenses in place, as the pristine white serving plate found its place onto the centre of my table, it became immediately obvious to me that tomatoes, cheese, and pesto had been included on the kitchens fast-increasing list of rationed items. And in that moment the obstinate camels back was broken. 

What had in its glory days been a magnificent gooey plate of cheesy aubergine deliciousness lay before me as an unapologetically dry starter, evoking nothing from my senses but pity. As we say in local parlance; ‚Äòshame left the kitchen, and caught me‚Äô.

Our waiter encouraged my sister and I to articulate our concerns to enable the kitchen ‚Äòfix things‚Äô. Where to begin? Eventually he went off with a long list of remedial notes, and returned the plate to his kitchen colleagues for an ‚Äòuplift‚Äô. 

Within 2 minutes the very same plate returned covered in a mountain of grated parmesan cheese, thickly layered for our troubles.

Unbelievable. 

After an additional ten minutes of detailed complaint and furious note taking by the waiter, we wondered why he was so reluctant to have that chef come forward to ‚Äòdefend‚Äô his meal. As it turned out, there was no chef in the kitchen ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

An extra five minutes passed, and we wondered why the manager hadn‚Äôt thought it fit to approach us and address our concerns. As it turned out, the manager too wasn‚Äôt due to arrive for another 45mins ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The waiters valiantly fought to explain away the multiple failings of the kitchen and management, but at this point the shine in my eyes had given me super vision. 

At some point, a call was placed to one of the ‚Äòmasters‚Äô and our overworked waiters happily advised us that our un-eaten mess of a meal would not be not included on our bill. We marvelled at the benevolence of the management, and left the waiters a substantial service tip for their efforts. 

As we left to one of the several restaurants in the neighbour, my sister and I took a last look at an establishment that had hosted our weekly catch-up lunches, and family dinners for the past fourteen months. 

At at the end of the day our repeated custom had translated into nothing. It hadn‚Äôt even been enough to buy us an apology (or extra bread rolls) from the management team. 

Shame left them and caught us. It was a long overdue departure.More",50,May 2019,4.0

Sacha P,One of the Best Restaurants in Lagos,"I was only on Lagos for a few days on business and was taken here by two locals. The place did not disappoint.
Inside is cool and sophisticated with linen tables and very attentive staff, outside has got a bar, a pool and a more...upbeat vibe with great cocktails and nice tunes. Seating is well spaced so you can relax and not feel crowded out.
It is a great place to be seen but come here for the food.
It is primarily meat, excellent, and fish, super fresh, but being a veggie I was well accommodated too and they are happy to adapt dishes to ensure you are well looked after. Portion sizes are just right and staff attentive and professional.
It is mid range price wise but well worth the money. If/when I am back in Lagos I will certainly go back and I heartily recommend it to others.More",40,December 2018,4.0

Ricalea,One of the good place in Lagos,"Beautiful setting with a lovely alfresco bar area outside and white linen dinning inside.  Ambiance is perfect - some live music (piano / jazz) would just go that extra mile :0).  Staff are extremely professional and fully understand the menu and guests requirements.

stanleymbam,Office Dinner,"I had some colleagues in town from South Africa, so I decided to treat them to some fine dining at The Grills by Delis and it did not disappoint.

We were 11 in all and had great cocktails and a fine wine collection. For the main meal, I had baby chicken with grilled potatoes while my colleagues had salmon, steak, shrimps and the likes.

Worldtraveler324685,Sick from the Wagyu steak,"We went to Grill by Delis when they opened and it was a disaster. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. 
This weekend my husband and I decided to give them another chance. We walked in on a Friday night and got a nice table...outside. The waiting staff is very well trained and are even capable of small talk. We made our order, the food was surprisingly fast, and tasted excellent. 
It‚Äôs definitely one of the best restaurants in Lagos. It is expensive but so is everywhere else where you can order good food (and also receive it). 
So to those who have been disappointed once before, i would recommend you to give this place another chance.More",40,October 2018,4.0
