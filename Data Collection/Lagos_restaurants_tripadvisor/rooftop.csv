JacksonLagos,Great transformation!,"I hadn't been here for a couple of years when it was pretty much a grilled meat joint open to the elements! What a metamorphosis into a sophisticated and stylish venue (all enclosed!) - and the food lived up to the surroundings. Before the table...used to be strewn with bottles of insect repellent but this time it was bottles of Grey Goose and carafes of cranberry juice, cocktails and glasses of wine while we enjoyed into the early hours! Would recommend to anyone as a genuine destination venue - at last! - for Lagos!More",50,June 2015,5.0

richtank,Best steaks in Lagos,"Have been to this hidden gem on several occasions. Not only is the food amazing, but the owners really get it. They understand that if you have a high-end restaurant and don't advertise then you have to depend on amazing service and incredible food in...order to build and maintain your business. This is what they have been doing for some time now. The space is ultra modern and clean feeling with a cool hidden stair that takes you up to the dining room. It's a great place for rounding up a group of friends and having a meal because they have some long tables that they can put together. They also have intimate booths which are good for couples or smaller groups. The steaks are really amazing. The first place in Lagos where I have ordered a steak medium rare and it actually came out medium rare instead of medium. Great sauces and sides round out the meal.More",50,February 2015,5.0
