61joyo,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"I  would HIGHLY recommend that you AVOID this restaurant/bar/lounge. Not only is the service slow,  the staff unprofessional (from servers to managers to administration). I was overcharged N265,500 and none of staff seemed to care about this very serous error on their part. The whole...story is below...

My friends (who were visiting Nigeria for the first time), my husband and I went to the Library on recommmendation. When we arrived, the atmosphere was lively and we were quickly seated. Despite this, we probably waited around 20/25 mins to give our  order and another 30/40 mins to be served.
After paying, the server held on to my card for about 10 mins without explanation and started slowly backing away from the table. I assumed that maybe the charge didn't pass. When I asked her what the issue was and why she was holding on to the card, she asked me to hold on. I had to scold the server before she eventually handed me back the card while showing me the bill. She said nothing so it took me some time to relaize that she had added an extra zero to the bill making the bill 295k instead of 29,500. 
Highly annoyed at her mistake, the fact she somehow didn't think to explain immediately what happened or to apologize, I naturally asked how she planned to refund the overcharged sum (265,500). She asked me write down my name and bank information on a piece of paper and made it seem as if the transfer would be made that night. So we waited to have confirmation of the transfer, which never happened. We somehow now couldn't see/find this particular server anymore. We happened to spot her by the entrance, and seeing my increasing anger and irritation at the situation, my husband and one his friends went to speak to her. 
After 10 mins, I was fed up of waiting and decided to join them. I found them speaking to the manager. My husband, who is usually very calm, was livid - probably because the manager had a severe attitude and didn't really seem to care about what happened. Seeing the situation and my husband's unexpected reaction really pissed me off. The manager, John Maina, offered absolutely no suggestions/solutions. On top of that, he rejected our suggestions for a cash refund (he claimed that the Library didn't deal in cash - even though one of our friends staying at Maison Fahrenheit had seem someone pay in cash the night before) or for a bank transfer made that night (apparently only the accountant could do it and he/she wasn't on-site). 
He assured us that we would see the bank transfer the next morning. Being Nigerian and knowing how Nigerians are, I said that wasn't enough. There was no garantee that the accountant would acknowledge the promises Mr. Maina made. We told him to send us email from his professional account (with the accountant copied) explaining the situation and that a refund was required.
The next day we waited until 1pm and, of course, no transfer was made. So, my husband and I had to go back to speak to someone and make sure the refund was sent. When we finally got to speak to someone in the administrative office (Titi), she was very rude and implied that it was my fault for not looking over the bill before paying. Yes, I could have, and clearly should have, looked over the bill, but to insinute that this was my fault was exteremly unprofessional. Then instead of proceeding to issue the refund, Titi decided that she had more important business to attend to kept us waiting 15/20 mins before finally asking to verify my bank information. At the end of all this wahala, the cheapstakes didn't think it decent to refund me the full 295k for all my troubles.More",10,Aug-22,1,The Deck at The Library
