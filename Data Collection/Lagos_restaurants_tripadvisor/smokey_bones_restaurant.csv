Sleekcheek,Amazing RIbs,If you love good ribs then this is a must visit. The ribs were yummy and the mashed potatoes were great too. The ambience could use a little more glow up but then again I don't mind if they keep making their ribs that good....Definitely adding this to my list of restaurants to visit.More,45,September 2019,4.0

Ifeoluwa F,"Great chicken, great ribs","I ordered rib bites that were full of Fat and bones.  The corn muffins tasted like a cardboard Box...The mac and cheese was half edible.  I was EXTREMELY disappointed  as i was looking so forward to a good American meal.  The place was also pretty...rundown, even my husband ordered for a white soup with semovita, and the white soup came out to be a red soup full of pepper, he cant even eat.More",40,April 2017,4.0

yewandeo329,Would have preferred afrobeats,"Nice place to hang out, food was good and well sized :)

Good for watching sports as well with screens littered all over the place.

johnmarkey67,A fine addition to the Lagos scene.,It's always hard to find proper American BBQ in Nigeria. This BBQ is close enough to make it worth the trip. I have only been for lunch but I have heard they have live music most nights.,40,August 2016,4.0
oly_monarch,Night out at Smokey Bone Restaurant,"I really did have a great time at this restaurant. The ambient was great, it was very clean and the waiters were very warm. I went on a Saturday evening and there was a salsa class going on. For a weekend, I would have really...loved to listen to afrobeat. Besides that, it was amazing. The food was great, I had snail and some isi ewu. Would definitely be recommending this place.More",40,August 2016,4.0
