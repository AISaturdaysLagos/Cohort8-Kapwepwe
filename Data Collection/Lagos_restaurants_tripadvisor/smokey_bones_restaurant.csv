Sleekcheek,Amazing RIbs,If you love good ribs then this is a must visit. The ribs were yummy and the mashed potatoes were great too. The ambience could use a little more glow up but then again I don't mind if they keep making their ribs that good....Definitely adding this to my list of restaurants to visit.More,45,Sep-19,4,Smokey Bones Restaurant

Ifeoluwa F,"Great chicken, great ribs","I ordered rib bites that were full of Fat and bones.  The corn muffins tasted like a cardboard Box...The mac and cheese was half edible.  I was EXTREMELY disappointed  as i was looking so forward to a good American meal.

yewandeo329,Would have preferred afrobeats,"Nice place to hang out, food was good and well sized :)

Good for watching sports as well with screens littered all over the place.

johnmarkey67,A fine addition to the Lagos scene.,It's always hard to find proper American BBQ in Nigeria. This BBQ is close enough to make it worth the trip. I have only been for lunch but I have heard they have live music most nights.,40,Aug-16,4,Smokey Bones Restaurant
oly_monarch,Night out at Smokey Bone Restaurant,"I really did have a great time at this restaurant. The ambient was great, it was very clean and the waiters were very warm. I went on a Saturday evening and there was a salsa class going on. For a weekend, I would have really...loved to listen to afrobeat. Besides that, it was amazing. The food was great, I had snail and some isi ewu. Would definitely be recommending this place.More",40,Aug-16,4,Smokey Bones Restaurant
