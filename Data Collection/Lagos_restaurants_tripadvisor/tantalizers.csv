DoubleTCatering,"Old Reliable, No Frills, Cheap Eats","Tantalizers was the one eatery I saw that was still in existence since my previous trip to Nigeria, almost a decade and a half earlier. 

With the market filled with more nimble competitors, the place (at least the branch I went to) had lost its...shine. Still, with decent food at an excellent price, it was still well patronized by locals. 

The Super Saver combo of fried-rice, chicken, and soft-drink I had, at the equivalent of $2 USD (including VAT), couldn't be beat. 

There's proper parking out front for about fix to six cars, and they have pickup and delivery. Cash (as always) is accepted, as well as local debit-cards. Plus there's a security guard and proper air-conditioning, in case anybody comes with hot-headed, none-sense. ;)More",30,Sep-19,3,Tantalizers
