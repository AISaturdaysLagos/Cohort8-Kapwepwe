onoriodelucya,Best pizza in Lagos,They never fail to tickle my taste buds. I would give them a 10/10 for their pizzas which are made in a brick oven Their rocula (rockets vegetable) is the freshest ever.,35,September 2022,3.5
948kait,Best Italian Pizza in town!,"Nice Antipasti, Pizza and Pasta! Well presented and with good service; all at reasonable prices when thinking about the quality. Perfect place to be!!!",40,December 2019,3.5
Tamdd G,Authentic Italian ambience in Lagos,"I come here often on couple dates and I always get the same feeling of being out of Lagos in a quaint Italian town, I love Italy and all things Italian.

Frederic J,"Best pizza in Lagos, simply!","Excellent Italian pizzas in a nice and relaxing setting whether indoor or outdoor by the pool. Great choice of imported Italian toppings, fine crust cooked to perfection in word burning oven. Delicious!",40,September 2018,3.5
melvin d a,Rip-off  lousy tasting meal,"Such a bland menu, ridiculously expensive in the midst of many eating places with tasty menu.  Agreed, their forte is Pizza but that is not an excuse to punish diners for daring to order any other food besides pizza.  even so, the selection of pizza...is very limited. in fairness it may be directed to pure Italian pizza lovers.  I am more American and looking for minced meat and other extra toppings on my pizza.  I paid N17000 for a steak in a city where the top menu in a 5 star dig is not even close to 50% of that price, just to put things in context.  I am also a long term guest in this establishment.  The entire premises is smoking-friendly which leaves the place with a perpetual stench of stale smoke.  Aged but well-kept rooms.  Everything works.  This is not my favorite dig.  Definitely not the go-to place for anything in Lagos.More",50,March 2018,3.5
Andrea Z,really good food,really good quality the place is very clean. Staff is really fast. Manuela is relax place afetr work day no nise just quiet in the middle of green. There is swiming pool with blue water. Tipical Italian Place,50,August 2017,3.5
DubaiKoos,Too expensive!!!,"Great pizza. However, the prices have doubled since last visit in February. Pizza used to be 6k which is already expensive and they now charge 12k NGN! That is almost 40 USD for one pizza!!! Crazy prizes no wonder why there are no other guests!...I was a regular customer but am not going back.
A shame...More",40,March 2017,3.5

The restaurant is not so big, but visual arts are so interesting, I love the...dessert!!!!!!More",50,January 2016,3.5
Jesse O,They don't have where I can wash my hand,"They're not polite. It's a good place. But I'm not sure if I want to visit again. 

Pizza is very good. But their lasagne has too much cheese and less meat.",50,September 2016,3.5
strawberryfield2016,The only pizza house in town I can recommend,"For pizza, this restaurant is the best. The interiors are nice, though restaurant itself is not so big place, but the menu is superb! from appetizer selection to pizza and desserts, so Italian. You will not regret coming over here!",10,August 2015,3.5
CSRam,Unfortunate Visit - Over Priced and very Egoistic place,"The service went off very well, they just took options like instead of vegetables they could give us Rice along with the Chicken we had ordered, the surprise was when we saw the bill, all options offered were billed separately, which we protested , paid...the rest which was not less as this restaurant is overpriced, the waiter did not say anything but they just closed the main gate on us not letting us out and also not letting the car go. The high and mighty owner refused to discuss the issueMore",50,August 2015,3.5
Marg M,Favorite little pizza spot in Victoria Island.,"Manuela's came highly recommended to us so we tried it for Valentines Day lunch! The pizza is very authentic - thin crust and not too cheesy. Maybe, for my taste, being American, I would have preferred a bit more cheese!  But their favors come from...the excellent toppings, favorite was the Seafood pizza!  The beer is always served in a chilled mug and the service is good.  Since we lived in Lagos, we visited Manuela's several times. The enclave in which it is located takes you completely away from the craziness of Lagos and you think you are in an Intalian Villa. One of our outings we always enjoyed on our shopping Saturday's.More",20,April 2015,3.5
Olya G,Pizza is good here!,"The only thing I tried in Manuela's is pizza. The pizza was fresh and delicious, the best I've tried in Lagos. As every other restaurant in Lagos, of course, it's overpriced! But the prices here are definitely not the highest in L.",50,November 2015,3.5
AdioB,Over priced Italian restaurant,"This restaurant is part of a residence-hotel like business. Its location is a bit clumsy as there is no sign to guide you, except the letters MR on the gate and the house number. The food is overpriced and the shocker was when I was...informed that they will be charging me VAT at 20%. They have no functioning electronic payment platform so come with a lot of cash.More",20,December 2015,3.5
Apapadim,One of the best pasta restaurants in Lagos,"In the center of V.I. hidden in a full of trees place they serve excellent Italian dishes. Pizza is very good but risotto porcini is one of the best you can taste in Lagos. Value for money, special section for smokers. Their tiramisu is the...More",35,November 2015,3.5
nabihc,Following my comment of 28/11/14,"I felt like having a pizza again after last year's tragic experience in this place. Same same with an additional 20% on your bill, supposedly due to tax increase, but I believe it is rather due to temperature increase, sun must have hit their brain",40,October 2015,3.5
KapilV611,great italian wines and food,"Hidden in one corner of Victoria island (most good places in lagos are), this restaurant is part of a italian guest house, the building and decor is old but kept very clean.

howie999,Ridiculously Overpriced - Not Really Worth the money - but it is well run and its clean & safe,"To be fair, its not a bad hotel - its clean although dated, the quality of the internal fittings are good.

It is however...More",30,September 2014,3.5

Otb2021,"Racist management, terrible service and prostitute spot",I went to Manuela's residence with a few friends and was instantly charmed by it's cosy atmosphere and artistic decor.

ivieo802,Worst restaurant in Lagos!,"I went for dinner to this restautant with 2 friends this evening (we are all Nigerian). The decor and artwork was very nice.

ShallyWaly,"Impressed with the place, disappointed in the pizza","MR is an aesthetically pleasing place with nice staff too. I suggest going there on Saturday nights, there's a pretty nice crowd and food specials.

TimmoW16,Good food and quiet relaxing atmosphere,Ate here for the first time over the weekend and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere.

Megha M,The best pizza ever (outside of Italy),"Once a week I crave a Manuela's pizza, the crusts are super thin and all the toppings are delicious. 

On the other hand, the decor is quite confusing (in a bad way), and service is dreadful at best.  However they know they have great pizza...More",40,April 2014,3.5
Hkejriwal,Best Italian Food!!! Highly recommended,"Where most of the reviews says it has best Pizza in Nigeria, which is true, but none mentions that it is simply the best for Italian food.

Mohaned E,Best Pizza in Lagos,"Trust me, there's no place in Lagos that serves a tastier pizza than MR.

You would definitely...More",40,March 2013,3.5
P0rtf0li0,Hidden treasure for good pizza,I am saying hidden because it is literally hidden. you won't be able to locate it if your driver never been there. No sign board and it is on secondary street. But its pizza is lovely. Ambience is good.,50,February 2013,3.5
