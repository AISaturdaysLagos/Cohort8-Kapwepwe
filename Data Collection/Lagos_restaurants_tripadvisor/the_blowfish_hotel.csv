Flakey0933,Indian Food,"We sat outside facing the pool. The environment was pleasant for conversations, no loud music, breezy and the service staff  were pleasant.  

We had prawns and fried cheese for our 2 starters,  chicken and the pasta. All the food was tasty but we loved the...prawns best - fresh, tasty and value for money.   

The variety for main courses were limited though - many chicken options, limited choices of seafood and other meats. 

The wines were really expensive by glass - 2800 naira and we were given the wrong wine - a lower quality south african wine instead of Chilean wine which we were told at the start.   IT would be good to have at least 2 types of wines by glasses and a better price.More",50,Oct-16,4.5,The Blowfish Hotel

AdioB,Nice Indian cuisine,"Nice choice between continental, Indian and Thai where in the continental menu some nice Lebanese dishes are available. Seems all freshly made however nothing that really stroke my palate.
Staff is extremely friendly, as in 99.9% places here in NIgeria. Service is very good. The...room is a bit cold as the AC is always at max and it unfortunately drips on the tables positioned under the AC elements. 
Overall however, it's a nice place and food is decent.More",50,Jul-15,4.5,The Blowfish Hotel
