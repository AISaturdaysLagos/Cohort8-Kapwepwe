balogunt,Food was too salty,I always love to eat at OB but this time the food was too salty and my friend couldn’t eat it. When my friend told the staff he was justifying why the food is meant to be salty. Pricey but the platter does it,45,August 2022,4.0

Fancykrt,Christmas visit,"Serene environment, free of noise, so cosy that you feel at home.
The sit out area upstairs makes one feel you are by the seaside eating seafood.
Good sound system that filters through all the corners of the building.
The menu list was endless with...assorted dishes, drinks, deserts, for you to savour. The meals were prepared and served fresh with that inviting aroma that will make you visit again and again.More",50,December 2021,4.0

Itoks007,No candy,There was no candy for my little daughter and she wasn’t very happy . Also the bread as starter complementary was flat hot though I thought maybe because it was complementary it could be anyhow though I took a second off bought about that and...said nope 👎🏻.

Moda X,Absolutely worth every logo spent,Went to a nearby eating place but it was disappointingly crowded so I used goggle maps to search for a nearby place with great reviews and ocean basket popped up.
