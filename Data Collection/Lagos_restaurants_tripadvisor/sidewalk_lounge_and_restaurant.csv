Tope O,Shabby Service delivery,"No doubt the ambience was ok. We had pre-booked and paid money to the manager - (would not mention her name) on the 9th of September 2023 to arrive by 4pm. We waited endlessly before the first set of dishes came out after 2 hours...!! We called severally but she was no longer picking our calls (typical Nigerian style). Staff on ground apologized insisting the message of us pre-booking was not passed across. You can imagine the frustration . Truth be told, Side-Walk messed up our evening. We were there to show off Nigerian hospitality to a foreign friend and send forth a colleague. Would not be going back there. Service was not top notch.More",30,Sep-23,3,Sidewalk Lounge and Restaurant
Benedette I,TRY YOUR LUCK,"More than half of what is on the menu is""not available"" .
The food took up to 45 minutes if not an hour to arrive
The food when it eventually arrived was underseasoned. The spaghetti had too much oil in it to cause heartburn. 
The...ambience is the only good thing about that place but the menu and service, 0/10.

The mojito was wonderful.More",30,Aug-23,3,Sidewalk Lounge and Restaurant
EagleEye247,Good for couples on weekends,This place is a cool evening or weekend hangout for couples or friends. Not the best around but good. Good ambience and outdoor setting with and without roof. The music was a bit too loud but I guess it's their brand. The illumination is their...best selling point in my opinion.More,30,May-23,3,Sidewalk Lounge and Restaurant
Ace-TheEl,Colleague's Sendforth,"Friendly staff. 
Our order took about 40mins but it tasted really good.
Karaoke didn't begin when scheduled; over an hour late however it was fun when it started.
Overall it was a good experience",25,Apr-22,3,Sidewalk Lounge and Restaurant
Dupri00,Nice Lounge,"My first visit to Sidewalk turned out much better than the 2nd.

This tome I sat indoors with a couple of friends and couldn’t help but notice that it was a bit run down. They need to do some stuff about the large see through...glasses. They look old and pale.

They didn’t have most of the food on the menu which was quite disappointing because on my first visit, I had very good grilled croaker fish. 

The drinks were cold but for premium price you expect much colder drinks particularly on a day that is not really busy.

Overall it was just okay. They need to get back their lost glory. Not very impressedMore",10,Mar-20,3,Sidewalk Lounge and Restaurant

AdioB,Nice place to Hangout,"This restaurant is located in the heart of the business district, and its a good place to unwind after a busy day. Parking spaces are limited and you might have to park across the street.You get to enjoy seating inside or outside surrounded by television...screens showing live sport. The music was really good and  we were told that Wednesday evenings features some live music. The space is also shared with a grilling station.More",30,Dec-19,3,Sidewalk Lounge and Restaurant
popeourfriend,Not the Best place to Eat,"Some Colleagues and I went for lunch here and the first impression was... Lovely place. 
Everything went downhill from there. The restroom is not where you want to be Ammonia been the preferred perfume there. 
Then the food came - i would say the grilled...tilapia was okay and the peppered tray but everything else was terrible. 
i asked for an Alfredo and i got spaghetti- i wonder when cheese became stew. My friends asked for fisherman okro and got watered okro soup. After that we just left in anger. Never going back there ....PS our meal came 2 hours after we ordered it and not even complete.More",40,Dec-19,3,Sidewalk Lounge and Restaurant
yonih983,Good Hangout,Location is great for the hangout with friends after work in Lagos. Food and drinks were timely and the staff is responsive to customers demands. They have screens for live games and background music for a good chill out.,30,Dec-18,3,Sidewalk Lounge and Restaurant
char_les2309,A nice place to relax and network.,"A really decent place in the heart of Victoria Island to blow off stress after a hard day's work. They open from 4pm daily, cold beer always available, they also have assorted spirits and wines available as well. They primarily have finger foods and for...the lovers of Catfish peppersoup, their pepper soup with yam is quite tasty, another favorite of mine is their pork ribs with chips! I like that the music is not so loud to disrupt conversations.
Their prices are also pocket friendly for the location.More",50,Nov-18,3,Sidewalk Lounge and Restaurant
