Heckler987,Average for Lagos,"Anywhere else this would be a two star place, but given that it has decent food and  it's in Lagos it gets a third star. The restaurant is clean and kind of trendy looking. They have some outdoor seating if you like it warm or...comfortably cool indoor seating. The service is pretty slow, but better than average for Lagos. I had the Spicy Beef, which had good flavor but the beef was tough. Honestly, every beef dish I've had here in Nigeria has been pretty tough and this wasn't much different. That cow must have lived a tough life before being made into beef. Everyone was very friendly and even the chef and manager came to check on us (it may have helped that we had a local with us). The only other thing worth mentioning is there is a club next door and they were blasting music loud enough that it was even loud in the restaurant. It would have been really loud outside. We were there on a Friday and that may explain it.More",30,Mar-17,3,Truffles Restaurant and Bar
Samuel A,Good Ambience....,"Nice location and setting.
Club Sandwich and Quesadilla were good, their attempt at orientals dishes were no great.
Could improve on their service.",20,Dec-16,3,Truffles Restaurant and Bar
Gladys R,Truffles is the BEST!!!,"We decided to pass by Truffles on the way to the airport as it is just about 10 minutes away from the Murtala Mohammed Airport. Very convenient for last minute folks like us who are foodies that do not enjoy plane meals.

First things first,...parking was a breeze. They have great parking at the front of the restaurant with security to watch over your car while you are in the restaurant. 

Upon walking into the restaurant, we were sat within 30 seconds of arrival by the host after which the swift and efficient wait staff came to get our orders. The wait staff is really fast and also posses that welcoming feel to serve us. 

The food was fantastic - hands down the BEST club sandwich I have had in the world. Truffles offers an extensive menu of different items such that it was difficult for my husband and I to decide on one meal. 

Additionally, the manager was very attentive and was signaling the wait staff as to when to refill our drinks etc. I will definitely be visiting Truffles each time I visit Nigeria!!More",40,Dec-16,3,Truffles Restaurant and Bar
TitiDokubo,Okay service bad timing,"I was torn between giving them a 2 or a 3 star rating. 
The waitress was nice but she was the only one on duty serving over 13 guests inside. I am not sure if there were guests outside.

Each stage of the meal took...forever to arrive. I asked for a medium rare steak and I got a full done steak. I was really disappointed.More",40,Nov-16,3,Truffles Restaurant and Bar
693jeffw,The WORST service I have ever seen,"We visited truffles with work colleagues and the experience was nothing short of horrific... Starters took approx 1 hour to arrive and the main course took another 2.5 hours after that! Nigeria is not known for its speed, but this was the next level of...poor. Food was average at best.More",30,Nov-16,3,Truffles Restaurant and Bar
billsyb,Below The Radar,"We have been coming here on and off for lunch, after work drinks and dinner since it opened. 

This place is a welcome oasis in what is a not well served area of Ikeja - that said it is never busy and lacks atmosphere because...of that. Frankly, I worry it will still be around in 6 months unless things pick up.

It certainly deserves to prosper, but seems to be struggling to get its name around.

The waiting staff are all super friendly, and unlike other reviewers, I have not had any issues with them. They are really welcoming, remember people and what they drink, which leads to superfast service.

I have eaten there on many occasions, we usually start with drinks and then move onto an alfresco selection of starters - mini burgers, humus and spring rolls are all very tasty and well presented. One criticism, their standard portions are 3, which makes it difficult to divide if your party is even numbered!

We have also enjoyed heir lunch menu, which although unadventurous, delivers what it says on the can - their Club Sandwich is recommended.

Dinner is also good, choose from a selection of steaks, curries and other international items.

In summary, this place deserves to do better, it just needs to raise its profile, as what it has to offer is a nice alternative to the well known 21B just around the corner.More",30,Sep-16,3,Truffles Restaurant and Bar
Captain-StuABZ,Started okay but going downhill rapidly.,"Several work colleagues had mentioned the opening of this restaurant close to our company accommodation in Ikeja. The reviews were mixed so myself and a colleague decided to try it out for ourselves.  We visited and although we were the only patrons we were told...that Mondays were always quiet.  We both ordered the hummus which arrived with a generous helping of Lebanese bread and was both good value and pleasant tasting. Our initial choices of mains were not available so we opted for the French mushroom steak and the Thai green curry.  Neither were outstanding but perfectly acceptable and with an absence of restaurants locally we were more or less pleased.  We had 2 bottles of wine from a very limited selection (wines are listed as either red or white and nothing else) which were over priced at 6000N each.  All in all was okay.  However, all that was to change on a subsequent visit just 5 days later.

Hoping for more atmosphere we went back the following Saturday. A different waiter this time with some serious neglect for personal hygiene and so shy it was excruciating trying to order.  The wine was poured but quite a different bottle and quite off and trying the red was equally unpleasant as it was over 30 degrees in temperature. The hummus was equally nice but again our initial choice of mains was unavailable, in fact as absent as any other patrons, even at 8pm on a Saturday night.  We opted for the trio of mini burgers and a sweet and sour chicken in the end as our third and fourth choices stopping short of asking ""what do you actually have on?""  The chicken had burnt cashews and a 3 day old taste and the burgers were undercooked and greasy.  We left quickly, leaving the undrunk wine and made for some fresh air.

At the prices charged here you would expect a high end dining experience, it's comparable with many European restaurants on a price point if not higher but for less you will find much better and waiting staff who keep themselves less ""naturally fragrant"". 

The decor is reasonably smart and there is an outdoor eating area although very dimly lit and the interior is nicely air conditioned but the prices are well in excess of what they should be charging and sadly the quality lets them down.  It's a shame as they have tried hard with several themed nights, live music on Wednesdays and an aviation night with a good discount (20%) on a Thursday but it's not enough if the quality and menu availability isn't to be found.More",50,Apr-16,3,Truffles Restaurant and Bar
