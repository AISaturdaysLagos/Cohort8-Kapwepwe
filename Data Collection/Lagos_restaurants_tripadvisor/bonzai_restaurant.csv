Excalibernono,Poison sushi,"This is what was sold to me today that is as good as poison.  The smell is so bad that even a blind person will know it was spoilt.  Pls note that this is my first time ordering sushi from your restaurant, and it surely...will be the last time.   I Normally eat sushi at bungalows and I frequently eat sushi abroad but I will give your resturant a PhD award of the most terrible sushi I have ever ordered that is not fit for Human consumption and the best place for it is in the Dustbin.  Thank you for wasting my money and giving me a truly terrible experience with your resturant but I shall let the world know never to come and buy food at your resturant.More",40,January 2023,4.0
ummyd2019,Delicious Sushi,"For the past five years Iâ€™ve always come here alone. Thatâ€™s how amazing it is ðŸ˜‹

Always go for a sushi platter, I promise you  wonâ€™t regret it. Always fresh and yummy. And you can always ask for a fish to be replaced for another...one. Average sushi platter costs N10,500.

Cheese cake tastes soo good.

Amazing ambiance, good food,great music, love it!More",45,February 2020,4.0
JoanO539,Amazing Experience,"I went to Bonzai with a group of 3 other girlfriends for  dinner at their Tepanyaki  station and it was an amazing !!
From start to finish, you could tell that  they went to great lengths to ensure we had a good evening. 
The Sushi...was delicious, the bread was nice, the soup was very tasty and the dinner itself was sumptuous. We had lobsters, chicken, fish and prawns and there were no complaints on any item. Rice was delicious the vegetables were crunchy and all the protein deliciously seasoned. The show was nice too.

Service was Excellent. It would have been nice to have my preferred wine choice in stock and not have to buy a more expensive wine, but that didn't dampen our evening.   There was even a surprise Desert ""mothers day""  ice cream at the end, all on the house. That was a very nice touch. We all had a very enjoyable time. We will be back for sure!More",45,March 2019,4.0

Tonia Eka A,Excellent sushi,"Good Sushi and Sashimi. The decor is nice and the open  cooking stations looked interesting.

The large bar dominates the restaurant and the patrons are permitted to smoke. That destroys the taste buds so the taste of the food is lost.

Service was really slow....On balance, I won't be back.More",30,July 2017,4.0
