_abisheart,"brilliant music, excellent food and reasonably priced drinks","it‚Äôs under new management so has a totally revamped and fresh vibe, but has stayed true to its legacy of being a great place to hang out .
Had a night out with friends, drinks and food prices are brilliant .The food looked appetizing and...was really tasty  and on the top floor, the dj was on top of his game. 
Cost of drinks are very reasonable if you like to buy your spirits in bottles 
really really good vibe üëçüèΩüëçüèΩMore",50,September 2019,4.0

eziefulechidinma,It's been a while,"Haven't been here in a looooong while, but I do remember I loved their Barracuda and chips and would eat it for lunch at least 2ce a week.

Keith R,"Very hard to find, but quite good service","We came here with a few locals. We would never have found it on our own since it's deep in a plot in what looks like residential or light industry (it was dark). The locals recommended it when they have live music - which wasn't...on the night we came.

We didn't end up staying for dinner, although the menu looked good with many Nigerian specialties.

The service was attentive and accommodated our large group well.More",30,September 2015,4.0
