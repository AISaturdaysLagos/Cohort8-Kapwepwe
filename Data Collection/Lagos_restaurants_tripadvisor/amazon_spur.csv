CookieEllla,Dinner meal,"I’m a regular guest of Spur..but I was amazed today of how I was treated.today 9:43 I walk into the cafe to get a food I pod with my Atm card as usual and they said it was decline…I went to bring my phone to...check what was wrong but I was debited and I was talking to the manager that don’t even feel remorseful if the guest is hungry or about to die he said I have to pay another money after have been debited before I can get my goods and also said I can go to mu bank 
This is a manager of a company talking to someone anyhow but I paid again and left the promise 
I feel stupid and embarrassed the way I was treated today and I won’t recommend this restaurant again..I paid twice for a meal

NonemekCreativity,Do you want to treat yourself with steak?,"Terrible.

Poorly ventilated, smoke filled, smelly and greasy dump.

The ‘fast’ food burgers took over 30 minutes to arrive, and when they did arrive they were utterly sh1te . . . what a complete waste of time and money.

The management should be ashamed for...allowing themselves to serve such awful muck, and have the nerve to charge people money for the experience.

Don’t come here, TERRIBLEMore",40,Oct-18,3,Amazon Spur

Ade703,Not bad but somewhat underwhelming,"The restaurant is just average. The BBQ sauce is ok, a bit over salty. The main issue is the security staff of Landmark Tower. They were arrogant and rude. It's clear, I will never step in this place with people behaving like ruffians and aggressing...verbally customers.More",40,Dec-18,3,Amazon Spur

abdulhakeem a,Ambience,"My first visit to Spur,Victoria Island was in December 2018, their food is tasty(i rate it 7/10), though i dont think they did a good job with the chicken and chips.
 Secondly,the customer service was top notch,both the managers and staff,there was an unusual smile...on their faces. i was forced to tip some of the staff.
 Thirdly, i absolutely love the serene environment. not to forget that the food is cheap. i look forward to visiting again. i rate you 8/10. welldoneMore",30,Sep-17,3,Amazon Spur

TitiDokubo,Great View Outside,"The spur restaurant is an ok place but for some reason I expected a bit more. While waiting for my food to arrive, some of the female waitresses were engaged in a loud and prolonged argument to the extent that I had to change my...seat (to get away from the noise) - this was both unprofessional and frankly speaking - ridiculous. Also noticed the waiters in general tend to congregate in groups (e.g. around some of the cash points) and gist away. 

The food however was timely and tasted fine, the drinks were just ok at best. Prices are reasonable and the ambience is nice, though for some reason it seemed the air conditioning wasn't cooling as it should on the day of my visit. 

My experience was therefore somewhat mixed...not too bad but definitely with room for improvement. Maybe I'll give them a final re-visit at some point.More",40,Nov-16,3,Amazon Spur
