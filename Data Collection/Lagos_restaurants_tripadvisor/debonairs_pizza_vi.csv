2852christie,The best in Lagos,"First of all I would say debonair's pizza is different from  other pizza vendors that are just HARD BREAD AND KETCHUP in the name of pizza(Domino's Pizza).

Unfortunately, DEBONAIR'S pizza are not doing a good job in promoting their products but I must confess that...they are the best. Thumbs up in quality, taste, varieties and customer service. SincerelyMore",40,Dec-20,3.5,Debonairs Pizza VI
vivir826,SCAM. Dont patronize!!!,"Poor customer service,I ordered online and transferred via USSD. I called about 30minutes for status and they kept saying their account has not yet reflected.I cancelled after about an hour of waiting but have not been refunded.",40,Oct-20,3.5,Debonairs Pizza VI
590onyinyee,WORST SERVICE!!!! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER AGENTS!!!!!!,"This is the worst service that I have received from any vendor. What a horrible and terrible experience. 
placed an order at 5:40pm and called customer care lines (Toll Free) SEVERALLY!!!!!!! And there was no response. Infact one of my calls met the toll free...line on another call but there was no call back after
I eventually got a call at 7:30pm from a lady who claimed she was just seeing my order and would process it. This is after 2HOURS!!!!!!!!! Of placing the order!

8:30pm and was called to say that my location cannot be delivered to at less than 12,000naira!! My order was 5,600naira
Meaning I had wasted more than 3HOURSSSSSS waiting.

Worst service ever!!!!!! Delay and no sense of time or care for customer!!
I will never purchase from here again or let anyone I know purchase from here

This is not the first time I am experiencing delay in delivery but this tops it all!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bad businessMore",40,Feb-20,3.5,Debonairs Pizza VI
