KrisJose,Fat and gristle only.,"I just chewed on fat and gristle for my meal, what a waste of time. Totally inedible. I wouldn‚Äôt mind but I come here regularly.

gcxotf,Dissapointed,"Maybe the most serene and peaceful environment of any terrace/patio/alfresco place in bustling Lagos.

olajideo2013,I really like this place.,"I really like this place. The outdoor has this arab feel, Alladin kind of vibes - Beautiful & Colourful. The inside is a lot more formal, with nice food and cocktails. Lagos is just that city!",40,Mar-21,4,Arabesque Restaurant
bunmiOdez,Could be alot better,"Stayed outside because inside had a cigarette smell.

TheLuckyTraveller14,Beautiful outdoor patio with a lot of mosquitoes,"The outdoors patio is beautiful, the service is as in most places poor and the food is descent, same as the prices.

Prepare for mosquitoes, the are a lot",10,Feb-20,4,Arabesque Restaurant
ibikunleo,Well worth a visit,"I've been here several times and everytime have been very impressed with the quality of the food and the ambiance. You may choose to sit in the garden area or indoors but, of course, it could get a bit warm or wet outside, depending on...the time of the year.

However wherever you sit, the fare on offer tastes just as nice. Try the very fresh tasting Taboulle or for fish lovers, you must have the grilled fish.More",20,Dec-19,4,Arabesque Restaurant
