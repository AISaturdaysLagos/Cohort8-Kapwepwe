Blackheart,"Wannabe ISO, service not up to expecttions raised","With their Display supposedly showing the progress of your Pizza ordered, they raise expectations which they obviously cannot meet. Instead of the displayed 10 minutes, my order took almost 20 minutes, the promotional combo did not  contain a cold but rather a warm coke.

Pepperoni...nowhere to be found on the pizza, but the Ersatz meat tasted interesting. 
Overall no culinary revelation here, at a rather high price.
The restaurant on the Gbagada- Owornsoki Expressway closes at 21:00 hrs, regardless of customers or weekday.
Not very recommendableMore",40,April 2018,4.0
262Blondy,Exellent delivery,"Fast yummy food. Quick and prompt delivery, all still hot. Pay on delivery. Often and good discounts promo. Good variety menu with African style. My favourite is chicken suya pizza,which is not available back in my country.",35,February 2017,4.0
Phearphire,Its not the dominos your used to but...,"First the cardinal sin of any franchise in my opinion is to replace pork ingredients with substitutes, as this place does. No Real pepperoni or ham. You will receive a beef substitute which tastes like a beef substitute. Surely if we wanted beef we would...order beef right ?

Once you get passed this ... and you accept that it will never taste like the dominos your used to eating in the Uk or US... it's actually not bad pizza and it's delivered pretty fast at a very reasonable price, had they not broken the cardinal sin I may have rated them a 3,4 or 5. As it stands I dislike having other people's religious beliefs forced on my choice of food and so I think a 2 is generous.More",40,November 2016,4.0
Valdis A,Fast food pizza,"Fast food pizza. Not so healthy, but sometimes it's OK.
Delivery - is fast and hot, so you get a fresh cooked pizza.

ZurielKiru,Tasty Pizza,"Dominos  consistently work hard to prove it leads in the pizza business across Lagos generally. So far, I find their pizza yummy. Whether done solo, with friends or family, you'll relish it.

I still believe it can be better.",50,June 2016,4.0
Ibadanboy,Nice!,"Fast food pizza delivered efficiently in a nice environment. Tasty and reasonably priced, the Dominos Pizza restaurants are meeting the needs of those who want tasty and good food quickly",20,April 2016,4.0
ectravelermd,Domino's is Domino's,"This is a typical Domino's, nothing special or especially tasty about it. They will put on a special deal and then tell you it is no longer available, even though you just received the special earlier. When you ask to see the flyer to verify,...the workers stand around and just look at you. It's a little suspect but it seems that is how things are done here.More",30,November 2015,4.0

AdebiyiM1,Okay. I smell dough,"Sometimes it feels like this is the only pizza place in Lekki. I can understand why nonetheless, I've been here 5 times. Plenty of pizza topping variety. Big screen so you can monitor the progress of your order. Furniture arrangement is alright. Cool place to...hangout with friends. The pizza is the best I believe you can get in these parts till I'm convinced otherwise. My wife and nephews love it and sure is where I'd get my pizza from, the next time we're in Lagos.More",30,,4.0
