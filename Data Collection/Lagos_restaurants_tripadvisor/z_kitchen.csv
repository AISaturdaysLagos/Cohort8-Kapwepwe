shadylau,Quality food,"Elegant restaurant in Victoria Island. Had a set menu for 40K naira including drinks, a mix of starters, a main and some desserts. I chose lamb as a main and was absolutely delicious. Professional service.",45,May-23,4.5,Z Kitchen
Morten F,"Don‚Äôt go here, this is a place which was good in the past.","They have turned this fine dining into a bistro experience. 

Service was not restaurant standard front door was kept open to slow flies come in. We have to close it ourselves every time somebody went in our out.  

There was no napkins at the table...was down to paper towels, menu was reduced, sides was limited. 

For mains we had ribeye and slow cooked lamb. The waiter forgot part of the order. 

The slow cooked lamb was tender but way over salted. 

The ribeye was tender and cooked well. 

We got mashed potato‚Äôs as side dish it as well prepared lacked a bit of texture. 

Overall portion size was more than one person could eat. 

For desert we ordered apple crumble, hit the sweet spot this desert was outstanding. 

Only thing that was hit reduced was the price, 100 USD for a ribeye, that‚Äôs hefty in Lagos. 

Had the Korean Bau as starter, they we a bit bland lack salt and pepper as basic spice. 

We had mini beef sliders as well they were dry. 

This place used to be a place I would praise and even recommend to anybody else, to me z kitchen is dead as a fine dining place.More",40,Apr-23,4.5,Z Kitchen
hyperia124,Not Wao anymore,"Quite expensive if you invite a group of people and you take a three course meal plus alcohol. The service was slow despite the few tables occupied.

Discoverlagosonline,I Thoroughly Enjoyed My Birthday Experience!,"I booked Z Kitchen for my birthday dinner, I was recommended by a friend and cannot say how impressed I was with the decor, menu, quality of food, and the cocktails, it was very affordable too!

It was easy to reserve a table. Staff have...good customer service skills and confirmed my booking quickly, checking in with me  again on the day of the dinner.

Located in the high brow area of Victoria Island the restaurant is definitely upscale. The security staff are polite and very friendly, the front of house staff/waiters were also courteous, paid attention to detail and gave me a lovely birthday sing along...

As I had a booking for 10 people - guests were required to choose from one of three set menus which included a range of vegetarian and meat options. One of my guests decided that she preferred the standard menu as opposed to the set and after speaking to the manager he allowed this in his discretion. 

I would highly recommend the seafood options - I had the calamari starter and char grilled king prawns with linguine main... Absolutely beautiful. Portion sizes are good too. The passion loft cocktail was a winner for me (I had 3). I really wanted to try the apple crumble desert but I was already full. 

The ambiance was charming, we were seated in a sheltered area which gave a cosy private feel. 

I have a sensitive stomach so eating out in Lagos can be difficult, however my meal didn't upset my stomach so I would highly recommend for anyone who's back in Lagos from abroad. 

I have visited numerous restaurants in Lagos that have a suave look/feel to them but are usually let down by poor customer service, low quality food or unreasonable waiting times. 

This is definitely going to become my weekend go too when i'm back in town!More",10,Oct-20,4.5,Z Kitchen

_shivona_tavares,Wonderful restaurant in every sense,"We were a group of five foreigners who were in Nigeria for the first time and attending a Nigerian Traditional wedding.  We were only there for five days and were recommended this restaurant on our first night. It was extraordinary.   The ambience, food, wine and...service were simply superb.  It was a rather noisy but that was because it was so full of happy customers.More",40,Feb-20,4.5,Z Kitchen
Rob19822891,With proper French fries this place would be 5 stars,"Nice restaurant. Atmosphere consistently the best of any of the ‚Äúupmarket‚Äù eateries in VI. Cocktails and wine list are top notch. 

One thing... it seems small but it‚Äôs significant... please urgently rethink your ‚Äúfries‚Äù. They aren‚Äôt fries they‚Äôre at best overdone potato chips. Absolutely impossible...to eat as you can‚Äôt get them on your fork and when you do manage to shovel some into your mouth they aren‚Äôt worth the effort! Please, pleeeeeease... just give us some nicely cooked NORMAL French fries to eat with our steak and don‚Äôt try to fix something that isn‚Äôt broken!

Other than that, keep up the good work! üëçMore",50,Nov-19,4.5,Z Kitchen

bleu_et_gris,Must try when in Lagos,"Z Kitchen is a fantastic addition to the Lagos dining scene. I have been here a dozen times now since it opened a year ago. The setting is a modern and clean decor and there is always a beautiful crowd and great ambiance. Reservations are...a must, particularly for dinner on Mondays, where it is one of the few (only?) high end restaurants operating.

The menu is a mix of refined comfort food and classics with a twist. I have tasted many items on it and can recommend most of them. The calamari appetiser ,quinoa salad and king prawns are some of my go-to picks. Prices are on the higher side but very much in line with other restaurants of this standard. The staff are attentive and knowledgeable and the owner couple (husband in the kitchen, wife out front) are always around to ensure everything is running smoothly. The one time I had a complaint during the early teething period the manager was quick to remedy the situation even beyond my expectation.

Highly recommended for any occasion but particularly if you are looking to impress.More",50,Oct-19,4.5,Z Kitchen
