garygeorge3,Great vibe and good food,"Came down on the night we arrived, a friendly relaxed sports bar that sells decent drinks and food. Had pizza and chips, the amount of chips was amazing, a plate full with plenty of mayonnaise to dip into. It starts off quietly but gets really...busy around 10 pm, that said tables were still available. Great to relax after a long days work.More",40,May-19,4,Goodies Restaurant and Coffee Shop

Ravi Pradeep P,Best Shawarma Plate in town,"They have some good food, but the shawarma plate is just amazing. Goodies is a bit on the pricey side and can do better with their service, but the food makes it worthwile.",35,Feb-18,4,Goodies Restaurant and Coffee Shop
oga_kales,Ramadan days: Iftar at Goodies,"Was visiting Lagos for a business trip, got tired of the common rice and meat meals around, decided to try Goodies for the Lebanese food. I ordered dish of the day which was minced meat in tomatoes sauce oven cooked, also tried there noodles, lentil...soup, and salad. In summary, the food taste was 6/10, the service was terrible if not for a Syrian employee who made life easier for us, he explained to us Ramadan timings and what is available etc. I think it's better off a supermarket, bakery and take-away.More",40,Jun-18,4,Goodies Restaurant and Coffee Shop

TitiDokubo,Multipurpose,"This is a supermarket you visit and end up having lunch and dinner. Lol.

Their salads are crunchy, fresh and healthy. The food portions are also large and filling. However, large is relative.",40,Oct-16,4,Goodies Restaurant and Coffee Shop
Evetstravelfun,"Coffee, Pastries & Cafe ❤️",This is a comfortable place to grab a bite of good food with a variety of things to try. I can't say I totally like everything I have tried but there is enough I do like. Waiters are friendly and service is fast. We have...made it a regular hangout especially on market day! Very clean also. Highly recommended for casual cafe!More,40,Jun-15,4,Goodies Restaurant and Coffee Shop

ArynAjalaTravel,Our own starbucks,I love Goodies. The coffee and snack bar is always so tempting. They make excellent chocolate drinks and several variants of coffee. I tagged them Nigerian Starbucks,40,Dec-14,4,Goodies Restaurant and Coffee Shop
FatimahAK,I LOVE!,I love their doughnuts and cakes! the supermarket is great because you can find a lot of things you wont find locally because I think its targeted more towards expats but I love the one at Ikeja and the Ikoyi branch.,40,Aug-14,4,Goodies Restaurant and Coffee Shop
CJPSanRamon,"Had to try it, not overly impressed","Had to try it as many folks recommended it.  Was not greatly impressed and although I should give it another chance there are many other places deserving a first or second look instead.  If I find myself in the area and need to grab something...sure, but I wont go out of my way.

Food was ok, service was good, prices were ok, nothing OUTSTANDING.  I much rather go to the bakery and get a coffee and roll.

I gave it an average barely.More",40,May-14,4,Goodies Restaurant and Coffee Shop
Sasa_N_O_13,Mixed feelings about this one,"The whole place s very clean. Food s of good quality, and service s generally good. Waters are polite and quick to serve you. The only quite annoying part is that one of (i guess Lebanese) staff was standing behind my back at some distance,...winking and starring at my female companion, which she told me about only later to avoid conflict. Other than that, I recommend this place to everyone in need of good food at relatively reasonable prices.More",40,Jun-14,4,Goodies Restaurant and Coffee Shop
AhujaKamal,Excellent Cafe in Ikeja,"One does not expect too much from a café that is part of a Super Store, but this became a place for me to go back to again and again. Luckily it was at a walking distance for me.Food is fresh and authentic. Be it...salads, sandwiches, Lebanese or their daily lunch. Menu is perfect and one can really come in here for a meal.They have an exciting display of cakes, pastries and tarts that are not only good looking but really tasty as well. Although I am the kinds to enjoy local cuisine of a place on my travels and while in Lagos I did quite a bit of it, but Goodies café was like home where I could come in for a coffee or lunch and enjoy. The café is spacious and on the floor above the super store.Staff is friendly and so the whole experience is great.More",40,Jun-14,4,Goodies Restaurant and Coffee Shop
