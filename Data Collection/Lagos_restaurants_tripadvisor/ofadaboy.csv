Mayowa I,Waste of Time and Money,"The waiting time for food is ridiculously long. I had to wait for 1 and a half hour to get my take out pack. The food was ridiculously small and alarmingly expensive. I spent about 32,000 on 4 take outs and the food was like...a baby portion...

Do not waste your money.More",50,April 2023,4.0

GoPlaces472535,Terrible service,I was taken here on my first visit to Nigeria by a colleague so I could try some local food. Nice place with amazing food which I loved. Not a fan of Palm wine though but that is  probably just my English taste!,40,March 2021,4.0
yinkus2016,Nice Ofada Dishes,"The food was okay but very poor service, the waiters should ensure people are taken care of, we should not have to call your attention repeatedly, I was so disappointed",20,March 2020,4.0
Yourfavoritegirltola,My review,"If you love Ofada Rice(Local unpolished Rice), you should visit this place. The dishes are tasty and pain stakingly prepared. 
You will find a variety of stews to eat it with.",40,July 2019,4.0
omohunola,Local vibe,"It was a random day in July,I was out with friends to celebrate someone‚Äôs birthday,it was all our first times and we were unsure of the location so we ordered an Uber.We were dropped off randomly on the street and we literally passed the entrance...5 times before realizing we were there
Fast forward to when we got inside,beautiful scenery although a lot smaller than what it appeared to be like in pictures 
We had two choices ;eat inside or the outdoor area,it was a rainy day so we sat inside guided to out seats by a lovely waiter in this cute Yoruba ish get up
We ordered the regular,the ofada rice,it came with a side of plaintain and the whole dish in its entirety was simply lovely and I must say delicious,unfortunately I do not have any pictures of the food 
In conclusion,I‚Äôd be visiting again real soon,the only downside to it is the building is not all that noticeable and relatively small. The staff were really nice and polite and customer service was on point,the food was affordable for a price of 1500 ,they had lovely looking cocktails though I didn‚Äôt try any
It‚Äôs a wonderful location for a serene meeting for lovers and a cool hang out place for friends and trust me your pictures are going to be the bombMore",50,October 2019,4.0
Adebola01,Overly salty catfish and sauce,"I could have passed by this place without realising it was a restaurant. Also parking can be a hassle since the street is narrow. 

Visited with friends! Our waiter was not on top of his game that day as he was attending to another table...and clearly forgetting simple orders/requests.
However the food was great,  portion not so great if you're really hungry! 
Atmosphere was a vibe with really nice Nigerian oldies playing in the background + waiters dressed in local outfits!More",40,October 2019,4.0
Omelebele N,My visit to Ofada boy,"The Deluxe ofada i ordered came at promised delivery time, but the sauce and fish was excessively salty.also there was no eran in the sauce as promised. 
It was also an ofada sauce with just 2 ofal.

I honestly didn't get value for my money.",20,July 2019,4.0
Tonyola_xo,This place sent me to the toilet the next Day!!!!,"Lovely concept for local dishes,best local food packaging with service . personal service and verity of both local and continental cocktails . your request is just a press away !",50,February 2019,4.0
Emmeline O,Simply Perfect,"Ofada Boy !

I was so happy to visit one of mainland‚Äôs hotspot and I was not impressed. It‚Äôs just basic nothing so wow about it.

Ambience 
The place is kinda small, poor lighting and kinda creative.

Food
We got the famous Ofada and it...was extremely basic. It took them a long time to get our food ready and after the wait it wasn‚Äôt worth the hype.

I spent the next day in the toilet, literally had to run out of church to the bathroom 

Drink
We got Chapman, nothing special

Price
Affordable 

Parking 
No parking space and the road is extremely tinyMore",20,April 2019,4.0

Rebecca C,BEST FOOD IN NIGERIA! BEST FUN IN NIGERIA!  PALM WINE FOR THE WIN!,"Ofada Boy has really nice food. So many types of Ofada combinations and protein. The space itself is not large, but there's outdoor seating and indoor seating (with ACs). I advise you to take a taxi there as the street is narrow, making parking a...chore.More",40,December 2018,4.0
