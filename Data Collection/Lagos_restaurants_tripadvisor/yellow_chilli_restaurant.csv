hopej702,Amazing Restaurant (Must Go Here Every Time On Any Occasion),"This food is amazing. It reminds me of what I was eating when I was little. I love the rice and shrimp and the soup and beef, etc. It was delicious.  1000/10. More people should come and visit this place.",40,December 2022,4.0
Amah88,Terrible,The girl at the counter literally chucked the paid cash to her under the counter table then came back to say the funds were not complete. So she literally stole some right in front of us and I counted this cash before handing it over.,45,November 2022,4.0
chiomai593,Review on Yellow Chilli Restaurant,Yellow Chilli Restaurant is situated on the Island in Lagos. They boast of the finest cuisines in seafood and pepper soups. Their oxtail pepper soup was so savoury and nicely prepared with pepper to taste. What I enjoyed most about the oxtail is the softness...and tenderness. I really enjoyed each bite with the well blended spices that made my day worthwhile. It is a place to be and one of the best places to spend your money as far you are looking for well prepared dishes that are not the regulars.More,35,March 2023,4.0
yemio976,Great African food at decent prices,A party of 6 went there for dinner - we had a French visitor who wanted to try African food. My efo-riro was simply delicious. Our french visitor had the seafood okra and snail. The snail was tasty (and spicy!). My colleague had Afang soup...and he was also raving about his. The service was great - the waiter made one error and promptly corrected it. I will go back this week for the afang soup to see what the fuss was about.More,40,February 2023,4.0

Amah88,"The girl at the counter is a thief, mannerless and hateful, and her manager does not mind the behaviour","So I went in with my family as we just came in from the UK, first it was the hostile welcome, then the thieving, I gave her cash for my food and she slipped the cash right under the counter while at the same time...acting like she was talking to a colleague, all to come back up and say the money was short a good deal amount, which is impossible for me to miss out on my end, I didn’t argue I just topped up the money but my husband saw her move the money and her manager was right there!,More",50,May 2022,4.0

SAN-ENTINES,GENERALLY  EXCELLENT SERVICE & FOOD,"I was in Ikeja for about two and a half weeks and went to this restaurant 7 times for dinner. It is within walking distance from Ikeja Marriot hotel where we were staying so we went back many times because we enjoyed the food and...the staff were very professional.
