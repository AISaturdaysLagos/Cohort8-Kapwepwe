dadachu,"Great Steakhouse, Very nice ambiance","This is a steakhouse/grill that also offers really great fish and Italian dishes.  

The service is very good, unobtrusive and attentive.   

The food is excellent - well prepared and presented - you cannot go wrong with any of the items on the menu - our...table of 8 ordered the variety and everyone was very very happy.

Nice wine list too - good selection of southern hemisphere wines.More",50,May 2018,4.5

655kimk,Great Grills,"The grill steak house is a good place to dine, when in Victoria Island Lagos. The ambiance is great, service good and the grills just great. 

The chilu potato wedges were not so good though. Otherwise I'd recommend this restaurant located in Eko Hotel &...Suites.More",40,September 2017,4.5
robertgB5456BA,Simply the best steak in Lagos by a long way,"Located near the Eko Suites at the far end from the main hotel building the Grill is a place that you really should go to. It was our last night in Lagos after eight years, have been here before and would go again if possible....The restaurant is clean tidy and away from the hustle, quiet in the early evening and we found ourselves the only patrons for the first part of our meal. Decor is subtle but overall a really well presented restaurant. 

The staff must have been especially selected and I could not possibly fault the service received.

Although steak is the primary dish there are other sections too so The Grill can cater for all tastes. Unless you particularly desire the American steak the South African steak is fine and comes in at considerably less cost.

We both selected the SA tenderloin medium-rare and cannot fault the way in which it was cooked and presented. Delicious meal and a superb way to finish off our Nigeria experience.  We accompanied the steak with glass of house red each and a bottle of room temperature water. All up Naira34,000 for the two of us. Given the quality of the meal, service and location, well worth it. The Grill is a must try location, whether staying at the Eko Hotel or elsewhere in Lagos, Victoria Island area.More",50,September 2017,4.5
w84,Excellent Steaks,"Our steaks were excellent and the service friendly, a nice atmosphere in the restaurant. You can choose between American and South African meat. They also have a good wine selection. Prices are rather high, though.",50,August 2017,4.5
jollofmaster,"Good steak dinner, not great...","Dinner to celebrate, nice restaurant in the Eko Suites but somewhat empty.
The ribeye was done pretty well but I felt it lacked the quality I expected.
The Salmon was fresh and pretty good as we're the salads and sides.
Good food, not great...",40,July 2016,4.5
robertgB5456BA,A melt in your mouth Perfectly cooked steak.,"The Grill located at Eko Hotel, Lagos Nigeria provided us the setting for our 24th wedding anniversary. We opted for a South African tenderloin steak cooked medium rare accompanied by a bottle of Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir. Arriving at about 19:20 we were the only...ones being seated and through the evening only two other tables became occupied. Potentially this could have led to an over attentive staff hovering around the table. This was not the case at all. Indeed there was just the right amount of attention given to the dinning experience. There is a huge price differential between the American and South African steak and this swayed us to the South African. The steak was ordered medium rare and it was lightly seared on the outside providing that flame grilled texture and flavour whilst the rest simply melted in your mouth. It was stunning and rates amongst the bests steaks to have been on my plate. Price all up with starter, main and bottle of wine was in the order of US$290. For the quality, location and the event we were celebrating; acceptable. Well done team at the Eko. It was delicious.More",40,April 2016,4.5
dirkv278,Super steak,"Great American steaks! Also good side dishes and vegetables. Wine cart is fine, some of them are not on stock. Nice atmosphere and service.",50,January 2016,4.5
Mooncake1969,"American beef, wow","we had lunch at the recently refurbished steak house which is now called the grill, prime American beef fillet and rib eye, grilled to perfection by chef Mike who is running the kitchens at Eko suites. Their Caesar salad is tasty and is great along...side the steaks. They have a fully stocked bar with a nice wine menu. The grill no has a area out side adjacent to the restaurant where one can have their aperitif and cigarette. Over all a great place to dine with wonderful service.More",40,July 2015,4.5
