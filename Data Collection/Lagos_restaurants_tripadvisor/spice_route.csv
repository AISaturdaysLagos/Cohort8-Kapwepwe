JusticeJoyce,Masks are not compulsory/ENFORCED,"Sunday Brunch Buffet Review:
Everyone is nice enough from answering the phone taking a reservation to welcoming us upon entry although the reserved table wasn't marked for our name. Maybe the accent wasn't understood... No idea. 

But the buffet @ N8,000 with only 1 drink...and no refills. Be warned. They have Pepsi products and their Chapman isn't overly sweet. 

Their dumplings are steamed and served at a separate station which is nice. The accouterments were 5 star great. While the mutton was cooked down like crock pot stew meat which I tried and felt was tasty for my sample. 

Shocked more Naan (bread) options were not available or at least a garlic naan but there's plenty of fish, chicken, veggie options for all palates and dietary restrictions. I dined on a day there was no butter chicken offered. But they provide a rice and a noodle choice. Salad options. 2 desserts. One was cocktail fruit In a warm custard and the other was fried bread in a liquid sugar sauce. 

Aesthetically the place is cute. 
Above a pizza and burger joint. 
Two levels. 
Tvs playing soccer matches were going upstairs.More",40,November 2021,4.0
