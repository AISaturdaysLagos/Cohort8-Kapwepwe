globetravell,Cafe BOMBAY....Little One,"This is a tiny little restaurent in Mega Plaza Complex. Very simple, basic and working restaurent with no Jazz. The food is good, but little high on prices, when compared to ambience and size of the other restaurents. Masala Tea was very good and so...was Dal Khichdi.

Only problem we faced when we went in a huge group, they took almost an hour to prepare our food as they are not equipped to manage large group of 10 -12 people.More",50,November 2014,4.5
MaulinParekh,If you on a long trip....,"I have been visiting this place since December 2011. I have been to Lagos multiple times in the last 2 years and stay for as long as a month. Since one ends up missing Indian food and also at the same time, one doesn't want...to eat out all the time, this place works. They have aloo parathas which are reasonably priced. Dal khichdi is another awesome item on the menu. Another thing to have is the masala papad - one of the better ones in Lagos. 

All in all, a very good value for money place.More",40,April 2014,4.5

pondheron,Bad Hair Day,"A couple of friends and I went to this restaurant for the second time in as many months for lunch on a busy workday. This time around the food was uncharacteristically terrible - insipid Dal Tadka, cold tandoori rots(!), uninspiring alu methi - the woes...were endless. The saving grace was the waitress who pleasantly served us - through all our grumbling. And not to forget some of the best pachranga pickle I've had in a long time. Prices are reasonable as is the ambience. Next to the Megaplaza Mall - perhaps worth a visit if one were to ascribe our bad experience to a one off problem.More",40,,4.5
