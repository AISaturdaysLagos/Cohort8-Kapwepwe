JayJazzy,Lovely for small group celebrations/outings,"I had a surprise birthday dinner with friends at Casper and Gambini's and it was so lovely. First the ambiance was quite nice and quiet (perhaps because it was a Tuesday),  the platter we shared was also quite tasty, calamari and ribs. The meals were...well prepared and tasty, i particularly enjoyed their fish and potato wedges. Nicely done.

The only but' to the visit was their drinks, all the cocktails we tried were either too sweet or over-diluted with water, one drink (i cant remember the name now) tasted like mint soup - a combination of plenty water, plenty mint leaf(s) and maybe a drop of rum, it was awful. we had to ask for another type of drink which wasnt any better truthfully. 

In all it was really nice and a bit pocket friendly. I ll absolutely take friends back there, we ll just order water and their lovely food.More",35,October 2019,4.0
