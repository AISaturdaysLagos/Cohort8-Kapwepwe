gcxotf,Quality in Lagos,"Right at the Lagoon complex, excelent reastaurant with emphasis on the quality of the food & presentation. 
Expensive maybe but definetly worth it, arguably  among the top three in Lagos.",45,September 2021,4.5
ooobabatunde,Exceptional Food in Lagos!,"Came to celebrate my Boss's birthday.  Wonderful ambience, very good dry aged steaks, exciting cooking process, very good wine selection,  warm and friendly owner and staff. A very wonderful experience. Contact your bankers before visiting though :-).",45,July 2021,4.5
jfermons,Best sushi ever!,"You would not believe that you will have the best sushi in your life in an ""all kind of food"" restaurant in Nigeria owned by a Lebanese. First, the whole restaurant is a terrace next to the river/sea in the border of the island. It...has a great ambiance and music. 

I was shocked when I saw the menu - they have pizza, hamburgers, Chinese, Indian and Nigerian good. In another menu they have sushi.  It was a recipe for a disaster, but when the sushi came I couldn't believe what I was eating.

The owner fishes in the morning and he will only serve the catch of the day. Spectacular!More",40,July 2018,4.5
ayinkeadamu,Horrible,"Horrible restaurant, staff and management... walked in and my friend and I were the only customer at the time. Long story short I asked if the sushi chef was around and the waiter said YES! I ordered my sushi, drinks and some hot meal. The...waiter walked back with a look on his face and I asked what happened cos I assumed they didn't have something I ordered and he goes he just wanted to ask if we were ok? Long story short 40 minutes later, waiter comes back again to inform us that the sushi chef is on a break and he wants to find out if they go ahead with the hot meal. All the manager had to say was he didn't know we ordered sushi and I simply asked him what he assumed we came to do at their empty restaurant of he couldn't even make sure an order went through. The damn restaurant wasn't busy. Just don't go to this restaurant except you are looking to waste your time and money and eat average sushi. Go to Izanagi it's in VI tooMore",35,May 2017,4.5
mjacob007,"Ok food, expensive for Nigerian prices","We had some udon soup, few select sushi and some tempura. The soup was very good. Sushi was ok too. tempura disappointed. The environment was a let down, there was a foul odor in the restaurant. looing out of the window, there were at least...10 rats running around, which was a bit of a concern. I felt the prices were high compared to other Japanese restaurants in lagos. Overall, I struggled to find a balance between price and value.More",50,February 2017,4.5
Phearphire,Hands down the best sushi anywhere.,"You would be forgiven for thinking you had left Nigeria upon entering fusion, the decor and the quality of food and ingredients stand head and shoulders above anything else you could find in country. The staff are very friendly and make the effort to remember...details for repeat customers, the chefs are brilliant, constantly adding new dishes to the menu. An ideal setting for both romantic evenings with a loved one and business meetings with high profile persons.More",50,November 2016,4.5
oseni_debola,Original and Authentic Japanese Restaurant in Lagos,"It was a great experience. I tried wasabi for the first time, prawn/shrimp dumplings, and the sushi. one was with avocado, another with shrimp and one had the eggs of I think salmon fish. It was indeed a pleasant dinning experience. Great ambiance and was...taking on a treat of Japanese culture.

This restaurant is located in Lagoon Restaurant.

Tip: Don't order individual meals for the main course as you won't finish it.More",50,December 2016,4.5
1811nickd,Best restaurant in Lagos!,"Fusion serves without question, some of the best sushi I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The owner and host, JG, has such passion for his food and this shines through in everything he serves. I cannot recommend this place enough!",10,March 2016,4.5
Mina K,Disappointed...,I had a poor experience. The service wasn't good....they present Japanese/Lebanese ... Fusion confusion at a high price ..,30,December 2015,4.5
Andrew P,6 by 2 boats,"A group of 3 couples had a great experience. We ordered 2 sushi boats. The duo and one other. It was a great mix of classics and specials. Enough sushi for all. We also indulged in the recommendation from the owner to get the marinated...salmon ""salad"" which was very nicely done and presented.  I recommend it now too!  Fusion has great sushi at a good value too!  Thanks!  I recommend this place for groups.More",50,December 2015,4.5
KiyoNigeria,Best Japanese food in Nigeria,"Fish is very fresh as the owner of the restaurant goes and catches with his boat sailing more than 4 hours off Lagos in the Atlantic Ocean.  You can eat fresh fish right after his boat returns to the restaurant. I never eat that fresh...fish even in Japan.
The atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty good. You can visit for entertaining your business customers or you can enjoy delicious food with your good friend.More",40,October 2015,4.5
GH777,Nice place and good lebanese food,"A very nice place next to the lagoon with a good bar to have a drink. Fusion has a good decor, warm and calm inside, having good view over the lagoon and the food is tasty. Well done chef",50,September 2015,4.5
karmal962,Excellent Sushi,We went here for our Anniversary.  It is the best place i know to go for sushi in Lagos.  The fish is fresh and the variety is excellent.  You can also get Lebanese food and what i like are the platter choices for both of...these foods.  The Prices are very high so it would not be a regular visit but a definate must for special occasionsMore,20,November 2014,4.5
Cineantics,"Best sushi I've ever tasted, not just in Nigeria","The quality of the sushi and sashimi is excellent! The best in Nigeria. Possibly one of the best I've tried from my travels too. I recently learned that the tuna and white fish is obtained fresh once or twice a week by divers who go...deep-sea diving. No wonder it is so superb. The hot dishes are good but can be competed against by Izinagi (also in Lagos). But no one beats Fusion's sushi (I've tried Bungalow, Sakurai and Izinagi). Ask for a guy called Jean-Gabriel, he makes excellent recommendations and is very passionate about food and extremely friendly and attentive to customers.More",40,June 2015,4.5
Alfredo A,One of the best options for expats,"Really good sushi food.

A little bit expensive, but for sure you will love that food.

It is clearly one of the best sushis.",50,June 2015,4.5
Ordy12345,Reliably good service and food,I have been visiting Lagos for over 4 years and this is one of my favourite top 3 restaurants. It services Lebanese food on one side of the restaurant and Japanese on the other. If you want to mix dishes the staff are quite ok...More,45,April 2015,4.5
classicchi,Sushi paradise,"I have been hearing about the Fusion Sushi but never tried it out till February and I was really impressed, everything was so fresh and crisp! The only thing missing like in most Nigeria restaurants is the proper wine which is very important to me!...More",45,February 2015,4.5
262Blondy,Best sushi ever in Lagos,"This is Lebanese, continental and sushi restaurant 3 in 1 place. Sushi is the best in the town, always fresh.
