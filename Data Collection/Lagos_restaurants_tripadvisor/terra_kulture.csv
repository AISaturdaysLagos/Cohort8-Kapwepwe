AHZambia,Spicy food!,We went here for a business lunch.  Food menu was a bit difficult to comprehend without the help of our local hosts; food very tasty (and VERY spicy!).  Great little shop upstairs.  Would love to return when it is buzzing in an evening.,40,Oct-22,4,Terra Kulture

ifymyboy,A fantastic restaurant,My family and I had a great time at Tera while visiting from Sweden. Fantastic nigerian dishes. You can feast your eyes on great paintings while waiting for your meal. We had nothing to complain about. Highly recommended.,35,Mar-21,4,Terra Kulture
antaresa2021,NOT SO GREAT,Alright so i follow a guy on youtube called wode maya and he went to this place and so   i decided if its good enough for the great wode maya it should be good enough for me. first of all let me say the ambience...of the place is excellent. love the bookshop. anyway so i ordered the ofada rice and sauce.the sauce didnt taste that great and there was hardly any meat in it so basically you are paying 3000 naira for just the rice. but i overlooked that and because of the ambience of the place iwent the next day and ordered the club sandwich and like a shandy drink on the menu. the whole thing came to 5000 naira .first of all the shandy was sour. not an ounce of sweetness in it but the real bummer was the club sandwich. as soon as i took a bite i nearly puked. its like they put stale tuna straight from the can into it. it just tasted nasty. after taking that one bite i just ignored the rest of it and just ate the fries. however i wasnt going to waste what i just paid 5000 naira for so i told the guy to bring me an aluminium foil so i could wrap up the sandwich and take it home with me so i can eat it at night when i am fully drunk and dont care about what the food taste like. and thats what i did. got drunk at home because it was a weekend and when i was craving for food during my tipsy state i just ate the rest of the club sandwich.  so all in all i wouldnt be going to this place for food again because i tried it twice and it was rubbish. however this is a great place to bring your friends and sit down and drink coctails. so i wouldnt write it off because the ambience is good and you can just hang out and drink cocktails here. however the food is a miss for me.More,35,Feb-21,4,Terra Kulture
Ade703,Good relaxation spot,"Terra Kulture is best known for hosting plays and other artsy events. Located in a central part of Victoria Island, it has played host (and continues to do so) to a range of different stage performances over the years. The second half of the building...also contains a restaurant and book/souvenir store on the ground floor and mini-museum on the upper floor; there you can find on display a wide range of traditional attire from different Nigerian ethnic groups of Nigeria. The food is quite good and with a fair price point, the wait time (~ 45 minutes) however needs to be improved on. 

Overall its a nice place to have a quite lunch or dinner and basically relax.More",40,Dec-20,4,Terra Kulture
mhveo,Had an excellent time.,"It was an amazing place to be. I was there for 'Nigeria's journey, cycle of fashion exhibition. Cultural attire of Nigerian monarchs spanning over 400 years were on display. Yahaya who curated them guided me through the history of a couple of them, and it...was fascinating. 

The restaurant was super dope. Lunch was awesome. They also promised to be in touch when the have concerts and other large scale events. Looking forward to the next time already.More",40,Oct-20,4,Terra Kulture

Phareedah1,Terrible,I was on a date with my boyfriend and after about 40 mins we had finished our food and were having drinks and talking and we were asked to leave because they needed the table.

Tia011,"The food here is very good, but ...","The food here is very good. The dishes are well thought out and well prepared. If marking just on the food the score would be 4.5. There are some inconsistencies and irritations which let the place down. With some tweaks the place would be exceptional...and easily one of the best in Lagos.

The presentation is lovely. The food is tasty and authentic and unlike many establishments, they have resisted the temptation to add incompatible dishes to their menu. This is good quality, local Nigerian food. We are fussy eaters but this place impressed us and we became repeat customers.

The complimentary chin chin and nuts is delicious. It wasn’t always served with drinks which when you have to wait a long tome for your food is an amateur mistake. 

Areas for improvement:

The delays getting the food on the table can be bad if you’re in a hurry or if you’re hungry.

The mixed meats soup on 2  days was delicious and generous, on another day there were about 2 tiny pieces of meat. We complained and left most of it but we  were still charged.
The ofado sauce lacked variety and wasn’t completely warm. Lack of consistency irritates me profoundly. 

The menu and the pictures on the website suggest they serve moin moin. When you order it, they tell you they do not.  It remains on the menu and in the online images! 

The closing time on this website says 12am. We went for a late meal, it turns out, they close at 10am even at the weekend. 

The servers are helpful, pleasant and warm but seem a little bit inexperienced. I think there needs to be more staff and more training. 

The new Manager is warm and pleasant. Her priority needs to be to get items not sold off the menu, train staff and review the consistency of food leaving the kitchen. I think it would be worth employing more staff and open later at the weekend. The staff seem shattered towards the end of the day. 

They also need to review their marketing on and offline. If information online is inaccurate - change it! 

All in all, a nice place to eat. The irritations are not off putting because the staff are generally pleasant and eager to please. 

We’ll probably explore other eateries but I hope this place attends to the areas for development. It would easily get 5 stars from us if the issues were addressed!More",20,Mar-20,4,Terra Kulture
