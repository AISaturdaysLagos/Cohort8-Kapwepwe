Vanessa O,Amazing customer service and classy ambiance!,Had a surprise dinner for my husband on his birthday and we had about 25 friends over at this restaurant . I enjoyed working with the team and didn't have to supervise at any point. Food was great and the service well coordinated. I will...recommend cafe Vanessa any day.

Pinkjacket,"Nice food, not-too-nice wait, killer service charge","It was a month after a friend's birthday and I wanted to give her a decent eat out so we hit town looking for a place we haven't both been before. Being a dude around town, I have seen quite a lot.

Cafe Vanessa came...to mind as it was recently remodelled - it has seen quite a bit of life as Hole 19 and then Auto Lounge. 

For a Friday night, the place was quiet. Maybe that should have been a red flag. We sat down and it took years to get someone to come around and finally we got discovered. Orders were taken and like a bad habit, I asked for wait time, I was told 10 minutes. At first I wonder which restaurant serves in 10 minutes?

10 minutes passed. And then 20. And 30 minutes. Without much ado, nothing showed up for almost a hour. We didn't notice the passage of time because we had so much to talk about.

I was very upset but when I consider the trouble of leaving for somewhere else, I sucked it in. 

Food came and it was lovely. 

And then the bill, I was shocked - 20% service charge? In Lagos? I thought I was dreaming. Paid up and promised never to show up again. The charge was double insult as it was out of this world and considering we got a poor service, it was terrible.

I guess I now understand why the place was empty, after all, who would want to go back again?More",50,Aug-14,3,Café Vanessa
