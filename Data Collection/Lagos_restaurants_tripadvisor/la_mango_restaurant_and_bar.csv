sharpiese,Food/flies/Phew!!!,"So I had visited over 5years ago and had weird looking/tasting steak. Fast forward to today, took my brother and family there.  Not only were we given the food we didnt order, the chicken (we ordered fish) was super dry and chips overly salted. Every...food we ordered was extra spicy. Flies were all over and no one came to clean up. Never had such a wack meal that cost so much. Never again.More",30,January 2021,3.5
squaree2021,Hangout,"A lot has changed at la mango , excellent service, delicious food especially their grilled cat fish and saut√©ed potatoes. You definitely  will enjoy your food if you consider making a reservation ahead.",35,December 2020,3.5
abatana,Hidden Gem in Lagos,"Good Nigerian food, small chops, cocktails, and liquor. The servers could be better though. Overall, a nice experience. The owner and manager are cool",50,December 2019,3.5
omohunola,Good food coupled with poor service.,"My friends and I went for lunch at the restaurant. Prior booking had been made and it still took forever to get our meals.
Service was extremely sluggish! The servers weren't identifiable as they weren't in uniform.  They seemed to be overwhelmed and unable to...keep up.
We requested the same things over and over again and still no one brought them till someone walked to the bar. 

As much as I enjoyed the meal, I will advice you do not go there hungry. Except of course they are ready to improve on their service.More",50,August 2020,3.5

429amaraa,La mango resturant,"The food wasn't so spectacular, the service was superb , the environment was definitely beautiful for pictures.
I'd recommend it though for group outings",50,December 2019,3.5
Jydeoo,Nice and Cozy,"I liked the individual tick your choice order sheets. The menu had a wide enough selection. Though I didn't go upstairs, judging by the number of people that arrived while we were there, this place is well patronised.  Patronage counts for something, as it means...the establishment is doing many things right. Kudos, keep it up.More",40,October 2019,3.5
Ade703,I'm glad to see they've maintained a consistently good standard,"I first went to La Mango several years ago and then again earlier this week (November 2019); it was pleasantly surprising to see their standard hasn't dropped. 

It has outdoor and indoor sitting areas, the outdoor section is on the rooftop. The food tasted awesome...and the cocktail wasn't bad at all (just needed a bit more alcohol). Their menu items arent too pricey and the service time (food preparation) was impressive. Some of the menu items however were unavailable and it also took some time before we were attended to (after waiting about 10 minutesto no avail, I had to go downstairsto the bar and ask for a waiter to come take our order) - hence the 4 star rating instead of 5.

Overall however, it's a nice place and worth a visit. I'll certainly return.More",20,November 2019,3.5
Dealoceans,EXCELLENT,"I always look froward to visiting this restaurant,It is always crowded and there are VIPs seats that give you your privacy.",30,May 2019,3.5
Willy O,Cozy Restaurant at Ikeja,"A friend took me to this restaurant on a weekend. It looked so ordinary from outside. We had to drive through a maze to the car park. That alone got me curious. We then walked beside a swimming pool to the roof top bar. Suddenly...there was so much fresh air to take in. The chairs and sofas were colourful and weather resistant! 
The staff were well dressed, warm hearted, engaging and enthusiastic about service delivery. They probed and suggested meal options until they got all of us smiling. I looked across intermittently and all other guests were equally smiling and chatty. 
I finally got my meal. It was pounded yam served with egusi soup and croaker fish. It was warm and tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The dose was right.
This is definitely a place I want to visit repeatedly in future. It has all the trappings of a great restaurant.More",40,February 2019,3.5
