irishboy4,Weird I mean strange weird!,"8.45 Saturday 27th October 2018. I visited for breakfast. A helpful guy directed me to parking. Walked into restaurant and it was deserted, absolutely empty, no customers and no staff. The tv was blaring out music to make your ears bleed. I seated myself and...waited and waited. I shouted but could not compete with the tv volume. I walked around and found the menus and sat down again and waited. I checked my phone to make sure that no nuclear clearance warning had been given to evacuate the area, however the world seemed normal. The menu for my first meal of the day looked good and I had eaten here in the past for a business dinner but unless I cooked the food myself Basilico was not going to provide my sustenance this morn. I reluctantly stood up and left.More",45,Oct-18,3.5,Basilico Italian Restaurant

TukeMorgan,"Nice Poolside, Interesting Decor","I went there to play the Sax at a dinner and loved the outdoor seating and the poolside too. I love how colourful the compound is. The dish I had wasn't impressive, it was just pasta and bacon but it was a Set Menu so...maybe I need to go there and order from the menu myself.

Tuke's Quest). I am a food photographer so can't grant Trip Advisor the rights to my pictures.More",40,Jul-15,3.5,Basilico Italian Restaurant
