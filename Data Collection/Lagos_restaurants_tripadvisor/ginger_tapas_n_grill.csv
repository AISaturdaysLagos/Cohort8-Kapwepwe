NonemekCreativity,He carved a niche,Ginger Tapas and grills gives me the hot spicy grills that make me feel like having the whole red wine in the world. I like the meal there.,40,August 2018,4.0
ZeeGoes,Tapas?,"When they opened, they were pretty true to making over priced but delicious tapas dishes. The whole idea of tapas is to spend bits on semi bite sized dishes. This way, you are free to sample different dishes without overspending or overeating. Not for you...to charge a full plate price for a tapas sized dish. Nope. 
I simply stayed away for the past 2 years. 
I went back a month ago because a friend dragged me along, and they seem to have moved away from serving tapas and serving proper sized portions for common sense price. Thank you. The food was definitely delicious.More",40,October 2016,4.0
Liglossmaffia,The snail sauce is the best!,"Starting this review with the snail sauce is a sign of how good it was. It was so spicy. I had it with some chips, asun and gizdo. I just need them to add some more sides. I know the idea of tapas but we...are Nigerians, come on.More",30,October 2016,4.0
TukeMorgan,Great Ambience,"I went there for the first time to play the Saxophone. I decided I had to come back to try the food. My friend had the fish which was really filling, it was super delicious too. I had the Coconut Jollof rice and the prawns....The rice cost N1,000, the prawns cost N3,000 and the Fish was N2,500. If you're going there, I'll advice you to get the rice and fish as the Prawns taste like something you can get from a good pack of small chops. The ambience inside and outside is really nice. For pictures of the amazing food I had, check my instagram: tukemorgan or search for ginger tapas on my blog: tuke's questMore",50,December 2015,4.0
Lola A,Amazing tapas in Lagos!,"Ginger Tapas was an incredible dining experience. The food here is amazing! Great flavors, delicious drinks and friendly service! We had the ""Gingjerk"" chicken, prawn citrus avocado salad, empanadas, gizdodo, snail, patatas bravas, and it was all delicious. Everyone's plate was clean. It's a great...spot to come with family so everyone can share portions with one another and try everything on the table. People at our table ordered the speciality nonalcoholic mocktails and mojitos, which were both ice cold and refreshing. Overall incredible dining experience on my trip to Lagos!More",30,January 2016,4.0
jeffamania,"Simply best meal, cocktail and service I had in Lagos for a long time....","Quiet, cute and unassuming place in Lagos. Great and fresh cocktails. My meal which was the seafood platter was amazing. The accompanying rice was soo well done I was impressed as its the best flavoured (non jollof) I've ever had. The waiters were polite and...attended to us promptly. Service was quick and the ambiance was spot on. And best of all...prices were reasonable. It's non often I'm wowed by places but I had to go on my phone and bang out this review. Well done to all....keep it up. I'll be defn coming back again and again.....More",50,December 2015,4.0
Yetunde O,Just Ok,"The service was extremely slow, and most of the items on the menu weren't available .My ginger mojito had way too much ginger, couldn't taste anything else.The tapas didn't blow me away, just regular fare. Truly expected more.",50,November 2015,4.0
Ijeoma S,Average,"The ambience was great. I really like how the restaurant looks and feels, and I think they even have an outdoor sitting area, which I always like in a restaurant.

Their asun is great, their cocktails, not so much. It is possible they were just...having an off day when I went, though. 

My only real gripe with the place is that parking is a little annoying. Surely, that little space that can barely fit 5 cars can't be it? And even more annoying, there was no security personnel to ask.More",30,March 2015,4.0
Yemi A,Everything was delicious,Went with a group of friends from the office and we all ordered different things. There was nothing I tasted that wasn't delicious. They've also got a warm and cozy ambience. Would definitely recommend it.,30,August 2015,4.0
KemiS,Cosy Sunday afternoon hang out....,"Second time at Ginger tapas.Came here with some friends for a late Sunday lunch. Cosy sitting, with a good menu. Had the beef ribs; ginger platter to share, couscous (very nicely made); coconut rice (not as great) and the jerk chicken. Overall really nice food,...presented well. The wait staff were attentive and knew the menu well so gave good suggestions on what we could try. Would return and would recommend.More",40,August 2015,4.0
Bola957,Grill at its best,"loved my girl outing here especially the sauce that is served with the menu. 
however, the place is too small and seems choky with no demarcation for smokers/non-smokers. Sadly for this reason I wont visit the place again",40,February 2015,4.0
Ckno,Decent look cosy venue,Attentive service nice decor and decent spot to have a few drinks. I never got to try the food but it looks like it would be worth trying. Nice looking joint.,50,,4.0
Omoba88,Nice,"Have been here twice, the ambience is wonderful.  Was there for a friend's b day.  We were placed inside the private room, dimmed lights, relaxing music.  The tapas menu is delicious.  Ginger tapas thumbs up.",40,,4.0
Y6571FYandyc,A Fair Start But Needs Some Improvement,"As an avid Tapas fan I was excited to hear of this new restaurant opening in VI, Lagos. A friend and I visited on a Thursday night and it was very quiet! The setting is nice with dimmed lights and was unsurprisingly peaceful. The first...hiccup was the lack of cold bottled beer requiring us to buy the more expensive canned version (which was not particularly cold). We ordered three dishes from the menu; Ginjerki - the self proclaimed signature dish along with patatas bravas and empanadillas. The food was good as was the service. The patatas bravas were a disappointment replacing the traditional spicy tomato sauce with a barely spicy mayonnaise. The Ginjerki was the best value for money dish and the empanadillas were ridiculously over priced. The service was good and a nice touch was that the owners came over to talk to us. Overall an ok dining experience but they have to decide whether they want to be a traditional Spansh Tapas bar or something else. And the pricing needs sorting out! It's early days so a good rather than a fantastic start.More",40,October 2013,4.0
