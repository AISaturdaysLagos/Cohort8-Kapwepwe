TheLuckyTraveller14,Weak and unprofessional service,"The waiter tried to ripp-me-off by telling that the price list was old and the prices changed, he told that I needed to pay 1500 naira more that on the pricelist.

I requested the manager, after some time she came and I ended up paying what was on the pricelist listed. 
About the burger: it was dry, and due of the argument it didn‚Äôt taste me anymore.

Keith B,Great Nite Out,"Although this restaurant/ bar / club seems way up a back street in Lagos, it is well worth a visit.
