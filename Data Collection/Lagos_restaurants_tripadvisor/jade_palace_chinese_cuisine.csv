NaijaBabe2016,Victoria Island Branch (Adeola Odeku Street).,"Jade Palace is one of the better Chinese restaurants in the Lagos. It's been around for a while, which is always a good indicator, meaning that it has 'stood the test of time' in a city that has tons of competition in the Chinese cuisine...department. There are 2 branches, one in Victoria Island and one in Ikeja. We visited the V.I branch, which is located on the bustling, busy street known as Adeola Odeku.

The restaurant is located on the second floor of the building. Jade Palace is quite expansive, clean and appropriately decorated with bright red & gold oriental decor. Tables are set in a formal fashion. It looked oh so elegant and classy. The menu is something else! A very vast array of foods were on offer. Everything from dim sum to soups to cold/hot appetizers, sizzling and non-sizzling mains of beef, chicken, pork, fish, shrimp, other seafood, plus vegetarian options, rice, noodles, desserts and plenty of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. There was a glossy, vibrant picture of almost every item right next to it, which makes customers choices easier; (refer to posted pictures). Our waiters were a bit aloofish and not very engaging, though they were 'handsomely' dressed. None of them wore name tags.

We ordered BUTTERFLY KING PRAWNS CUTLET, DEEP FRIED PRAWN SPRING ROLLS WITH MAYONNAISE, FRIED PRAWNS WITH SWEET & SOUR SAUCE, SLICED BEEF WITH BROCCOLI IN OYSTER SAUCE, FRIED RICE WITH SHREDDED CHICKEN, FRIED NOODLES WITH ASSORTED VEGETABLES and CHAPMAN. The food was very impressive, however the 'stand out' dishes were the Prawn & Mayonnaise Spring Rolls and the Sweet & Sour Prawns. They were amazing! The Fried Noodles didn't look anything like it's photo in the menu and didn't taste great. The Sliced Beef and Fried Rice also fell a bit flat, plus the Chapman wasn't very refreshing or sweet enough. Though we enjoyed the Butterfly Prawns, they were a tad bit oily. 

We really enjoyed our dining experience at Jade Palace.  It's worth mentioning that the service here is super speedy! I don't think it took it took more than 5 minutes for the Spring Rolls and Butterfly Prawns to emerge, so J.P gets top marks for speed! Service by the waiters was diligent and professional, though like I said earlier, they should make an effort to be a bit friendlier. I look forward to returning to Jade Palace Restaurant some time soon because the food is actually very good, regardless of a few 'hiccups'. I highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you happen to be in the Victoria Island area and are craving authentic Chinese cuisine. Great restaurant! ü•ü üç§ ü•£ üçõ üç≤More",40,Jun-21,4,Jade Palace Chinese Cuisine
johnmM7443DY,Great Chinese,Love this place the food is fantastic. They have incorporated a little more spice to appeal to the Nigerian palate and it agrees with me. Go and enjoy!,40,Nov-19,4,Jade Palace Chinese Cuisine
CSRam,Quick working Lunch,"We decided to have a quick working Lunch at Jade palace as it was close to office. We started with a Soup and butterfly prawns, Both were good, thne we ordered for some fish and fried rice. fish was good but the fried was terrible....it was so oily that we had trouble consuming it.It was literally fried rice. Maybe the management should look into this complaint.More",40,Sep-18,4,Jade Palace Chinese Cuisine

Mark S,the best butterfly king prawns and steamed fish,"with a very charming and attentive restaurant manager we were privileged to have some kitchen specials that were just so delicious typical to that of Szechuan cuisine. From butterfly king prawns, century eggs, special pouch for a ground pork dish, steamed fish with a delicate...sauce...it was a feast.More",40,Apr-18,4,Jade Palace Chinese Cuisine
Khadija2oo,Noisy!!!,"The first time I ate at this restaurant was about 5 years ago and all I remember was that the food wasn't great and the restaurant was very noisy. The conversations around us were very loud - don't know if it was the acoustics. So...when a friend suggested dinner there last weekend, I was willing to try it out again.

The food wasn't nice - the spring rolls were thick and not tasty. The chicken in black bean sauce was ok but the prawns in chili wasn't nice either. 

The worst part of the evening though was that a group of people were having dinner in the private rooms and were making so much noise. They kept coming out of the room and yelling and shoving at each other - we got the impression that they were really drunk. It seemed like a fight was about to break out any minute! The noise was unbelievable.

The waiters/restaurant management were unable to control the situation. When they left we were told that they were staff of Huawei who were there to celebrate an event. 

I'm definitely never going backMore",50,Apr-18,4,Jade Palace Chinese Cuisine

It's just ok... Food is ok (but nothing memorable or to make you want to reiterate the experience), atmoshpere is very 20 years ago.",30,Apr-16,4,Jade Palace Chinese Cuisine
Ianfung,VERY GOOD CANTONESE COOKING: MAYBE BEST IN TOWN,"Eaten twice during my 6 days in VI and is very impressed with quality of food and level of service. The establishment is ran by a Hong Kong couple with a chef from Guangdong province. The trick is not to order from the menu but...discuss with the owners what is fresh for the day: we had a yellow fish delivered in the morning and it was steamed very nicely. The steamed pork with salted fish is also not on the menu and was excellent ( so was the stir fried cabbage with garlic ). One is unlikely to enjoy the best if one is either ordering base on pictures in the menu or base on advice from local waiters. 
BTW wine list is also good for a Chinese restaurant but reminder: they do not accept foreign credit cash, cash only!More",10,Sep-16,4,Jade Palace Chinese Cuisine
