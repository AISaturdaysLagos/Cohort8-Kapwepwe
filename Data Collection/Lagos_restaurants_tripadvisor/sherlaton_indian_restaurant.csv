NaijaBabe2016,An Okay Experience.,"Sherlaton Restaurant is a place I've known about for many years, so you could say 'it's reputation precedes it'!üòÜ I first heard about Sherlaton when I used to visit Lagos as a young lady in the early and mid 90s. I've never had the pleasure...of dining here. 4 out of my 4 daughters adore Indian Food, and I was with 2 of them on this visit to Lagos, so it was the perfect opportunity for my maiden visit to Sherlaton Finest Indian Cuisine. It's located in the Cumberland Luxury Hotel, inside a part called Nirvana Lotus Hall. Access to the restaurant is via a short stairway, onto a first floor. The location is a good one- on Adeola Odeku Street/Ahmadu Bello Way- a very central area of Victoria Island. 

The restaurant is expansive, with vibrant Indian accents and decorative artifacts. The decor/furniture looked a bit outdated and old-fashioned, yet orderly and well maintained. Toilets were squeaky clean. I know Sherlaton has been open for a very long time, but I had no idea that they've been operational since 1976! üò≤ How remarkable! Our waiter, (didn't catch his name), brought us their first ever menu in a picture frame. Please refer to the posted photo of it. How cool is that!?!? üòé What an awesome memento/piece of history/snapshot in time. The menu back then was a lot more modest. üòÑ Meanwhile, on Sherlaton's current menu, Monday is Dosa Day, but Indian, Nigerian and Continental Chinese Dishes are still served on this day. They also serve Breakfast- (from 6:30 a.m to 10:30 a.m) daily. Service was impressive. Didn't find any fault as far as any of the staff was concerned. Food came out in a short amount of time.

Sherlaton Restaurant has an extensive menu that includes SOUPS, NIGERIAN CUISINE, INDIAN VEGETARIAN STARTERS, INDIAN NON-VEGETARIAN STARTERS, VEGETARIAN MAIN COURSE, CHEF'S SPECIAL INDIAN THALI (Vegetarian & Non-Vegetarian), RICE, INDIAN BREADS, CONTINENTAL VEGETARIAN STARTERS, NON-VEGETARIAN MAIN COURSE, CHINESE VEGETARIAN, CHINESE NON-VEGETARIAN, RICE & NOODLES, SANDWICHES (Plain/Grilled), ACCOMPANIMENTS, DRINKS, DESSERTS, COCKTAILS, SHOTS, MOCKTAILS, SOFT DRINKS, JUICES and plenty of ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. 

We were not very hungry, having had a rich buffet breakfast at a hotel not too long ago, so we ordered MUTTON SAMOSA, CHICKEN TIKKA ROLLS, CHICKEN SPRING ROLLS as our Starters, and CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA for our Main Course, then a BUTTER NAAN and CHEESE NAAN for our Bread(s). We got the VIRGIN MOJITO for our Drinks. Everything was delicious and tasted very authentic. The pastry for the Mutton Samosas was too dry and a bit on the hard side, but the filling was rich and packed with meaty goodness. 

The Chicken Spring Rolls were yummy, but I thought the pastry would be like the regular thin spring roll pastry, not the oily pakora kind. It tasted like deep fried pancakes. The Cheese Naan wasn't nice because it was too oily. That grease overwhelmed the bread and gave the cheese a weird, plasticky consistency. The Butter Naan on the other hand was soft, buttery and flaky, but in all honesty- I've had better. The Virgin Mojito Mocktail was just okay, slightly overpowered by the plentiful mint in it. Our favourite dish was the Chicken Tikka Rolls! They were juicy, spicy, well seasoned and packed with tons of flavour. 

We enjoyed the food at Sherlaton Restaurant, and I can definitely see myself coming back here to sample many more items from their copious menu. Prices were very reasonable- especially for a city as expensive as Lagos, so kudos to Sherlaton Restaurant for keeping it 'economical'.üëçüèΩThe food is very decent, even though I must say that I expected a little more from an eatery that's been in business for over 47 years. It was disappointing that they screwed up Naan Bread, which for an Indian Restaurant is not acceptable as far as I'm concerned. This is single-handedly the reason why I couldn't give them a 'very good' rating. Had there been a 'good' rating on TripAdvisor, I'd have gone for that, so it's gonna have to be an average from me for Sherlaton Finest Indian Cuisine. However, I must say that given the fact that they've been open for such a long time, they have to be doing something right, so who the hell cares about what little ol' me has to say about them!!! üòÇ Therefore, CONGRATULATIONS to Sherlaton Restaurant for this amazing accomplishment! üëèüèº ü•≥ An overall decent experience for us, so I'd go ahead and recommend them, albeit- not 'highly'.More",40,August 2023,4.0
