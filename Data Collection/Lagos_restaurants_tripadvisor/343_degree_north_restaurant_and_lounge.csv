Y6571FYandyc,Fantastic with a couple of minor gripes,"A first class dining experience with just one or two gripes. The service is excellent, the menu provides ample choice for all pallettes, the food quality is first class and its a very nice setting.

I have been there three times recently, with a friend,...on my own and as part of a group. On the first occasion I went on a Thursday to find that there is a live band each night from Thursday to Sunday inclusive. The volume interferes with sociable discussion so we moved upstairs to a lounge bar. The lounge bar is a very nice setting and affords a little more privacy than the main restaurant downstairs. You can still hear the band is not as intrusive as downstairs.

On my second visit, on my own, the restaurant was five minutes away from a perfect review. The music upstairs was fine and being played at a sensible volume. After I asked for the bill, one of the bar staff decided to play naija 'music' very loud. This took the edge off the experience.

On my most recent menu, the waiter taking the order either didn't hear my request for rice or forgot about it. Consequently, the curry and the bread came without the rice. I mentioned it to the manager (more about him later) and when the rice came he added an additional dish at no extra charge.

On the way out and thanked him for his gesture and told him that someone who understands that the recovery is more important than the mistake is a customer service champion. And he is... helpful, attentive, responsive and dedicated to ensuring a great customer experience.

Given the most recent experience I would suggest that the waiters repeat the order back to the customer to ensure nothing is missing.

My only other gripe us that the drinks are expensive compared to other Indian restaurants but I guess they have to pay for the setting!

Overall, a fantastic restaurant, great food, excellent service and a manager who understands customer service. Highly recommendedMore",45,Nov-22,4.5,343 Degree North Restaurant and Lounge

Tourist28246649239,Authentic with a fusion twist,"What an experience it was indeed. I guess in a place like Lagos, one doesn‚Äôt expect much when it comes to the smallest things like a smile from the hostess, or a waiter that really understands the menu. 

Today was all far past my expectations....We were welcomed by the hostess at the front door who led us to our table. 

The manager was kind enough to come over and talk us through the menu and dishes. 

The waiters was well versed with what‚Äôs popular and a must order.

The food was fantastic and presented very well. The biryani was somewhat different than that of an Indian pallet but that‚Äôs why that call it Indian Fusion. Frankly I loved it, suites my pallet just fine. 

Value for money, well you really can‚Äôt go wrong. We ate to the brim and it cost us 14k per head. What more can you ask for. 

Authentic with a fusion twist, oh yes indeed. 

A must visitMore",50,May-22,4.5,343 Degree North Restaurant and Lounge
Olumide K,A must visit,One of the best Asian Fusion Restaurants I have visited in Lagos. They can do a lot better with the spacing because it's usually crowded. Asides that its a great place with great ambiance. I highly recommend,50,Feb-22,4.5,343 Degree North Restaurant and Lounge
TukeMorgan,Do not go there,"Very disappointing experience. I came here with 4 friends to try out the MasterCard restaurant week menu. The starter was alright but the main meal (Spicy Cajun chicken pasta) was extremely tasteless. It lacked flavour and didn't look like it was freshly made. We asked...for a replacement or an alternative as we couldn't eat the dish. However, our request wasn't met, no apology was made and we left there hungry and displeased. The space is aesthetically pleasing however the service was terrible and the manager and staff didn't try to rectify the situationMore",50,Nov-21,4.5,343 Degree North Restaurant and Lounge
mike192008,Pride of Lagos,"We celebrated our daughters birthday today and it will be a memorable evening.Right from the menu planning to the decoration theme was planned by the Young and entrprenal owner Ms Karishma and we had a never to forget evening.
The personalised menus were printed at...a very short nptice and the decoraters arranged.
Our event commenced with welcome drinks and folliwed with unreal smokey cocktails and never ending starters.We all loved the Twisted Asun as they call it as it had an amazing flavor mi us the typical fat after taste and the snails were to die for.
There were several other specialities like their signature rock prawns and the shanghai spring rolls.
Then the feast started with generous portions of main courses and we enjoyed the Tikka masalas to the Mongian lamb to Mock duck Schezwan to Jumbo prawn chilli and lisds of their lovely specials,not mention the breads cooked in a clay oven to their very popular Schezwan Fried Rice snd their Jolof.
They surprised us with a Birthday platter where the whole team came out to sing and dance which was amazing experience.
We sincerely thank the lady owner who personally ensured every detail was looked after and it will always be fond memories for our family.
There was a surprise after party arrangements made at the Lounge above with a Dj and we danced away till the wee hours .Places like these become landmarks for a city bravo and keep up the great job and stay consistent.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüëçüëçü•Çü•Çü•ÇMore",10,Jul-21,4.5,343 Degree North Restaurant and Lounge
mike192008,Best in town,"This place is conveniently tucked on Kofo Aboyami next to Hartleys supermarket and has been hyped up a lot by every one in Lagos .I have heard several of my friends being invited for birthday dinners and wanted to try out the place which we...finally did no sunday.
The place has an elaborate menu loaded with goodies we tried the lobster grill and the salt pepper calamari and the Rock Shrimps as starters and they were on point.
They had a large party on at that time and service was impeccable.
The owner was around making sure everyone was comfortable and looked after.
Finally we tried the most talked about desserts and they had a new add on which was the Belgium Chocolate Fondant which was amazing but the portion is not shareable.
Overall a wonderful experience and we shall be back soon.More",50,May-21,4.5,343 Degree North Restaurant and Lounge

mahendrap669,Wonderful experience,"We have been waiting to see the place open since a very long time as we live in the neighborhood and we shop at HartleysüòäFinally the place is open and was a very very pleasant change for a evening out or to celebrate.
The decor...is chic and the food is just amazing its a multi cuisine restaurant with a modern cuisine extremely fair pricing and very good quality food.
We have been there twice and on both occassions the young lady who is the owner  was around to make us comfortable and recommended the days special and went out of the way to please one of our guests from dishes outside the menu.
Be it authentic Indian to Chinese to Continental and Nigerian cuisine they have excelled.
They have a lovely private dinning area which we had booked and service was extremely prompt and friendly.
They also have an exclusive lounge called Twist with Bar bites and amazing signature cocktails.
A very pleasant go to place in VI and a nust try.
Thank you guys for making our event amazing.More",50,Mar-21,4.5,343 Degree North Restaurant and Lounge
G6933OSstephenc,Lawrence,"Awesome Experience In 343 Degree Restaurant & Lounge. I had been for the first time and got a really good experience than any other restaurant I visited so far. Staff is excellent and gives an epic service. I spoke to the manager for some suggestions...on food and I got the best thing which I wanted for my family. I really liked what the management said that was ""We believe In Quality Food & Service"" and no doubt the words were kept. I will recommend this place to all my known people as this is the only place I believe who provides good quality food in authentic style. Overall I will rate this place 5 out of 5.More",50,Mar-21,4.5,343 Degree North Restaurant and Lounge
