TheGlamLotus,Nok is a Foodie Gem.,Exceptional Service and Food.  Love the decor and ambiance of this restaurant. Its casual creative vibe and good food makes this restaurant a must visit.  The Blackened Catfish with the Plaintain Beignets are a must.  They have a Moctail Menu as well and vegan options.,35,August 2023,3.5
329bhaveshm,"Amazing ambience, excellent service and food","Nok has amazing ambience with both inside and outside seating. The service is excellent, the food was very good , albeit they didn't have a quarter of the items on the menu. They also have a shop selling their designs.",35,September 2022,3.5
Figueiredo_Ricardo,Not worth the price (not even close),"Food is super average when it comes to taste. I asked for a beef with suya crust and the meat was tough and not tasty. Besides they coupled it with scrambled eggs (dry) and a random salad. 

Price per dish is around NGN10k, which for...me is a robbery for what I have eaten.More",40,June 2022,3.5

Dined outdoors. 
Had to flag down a server. Later learned he was the manager or someone of authority. 
They didn't have the lobster entree. 
Ordered Shrimp Yaji. Oxtail. Jollof. Plantain Beignets. Salad. Water as the drinks were not where...I wanted to spend my money given all the food I was happy to try. 

Salad actually came with a dressing that was not mayo based as it seems to be the standard here. 

They grill live as we sat too close and the smokey grill can reach you at some point. 

Cute ambience for the patio/outdoor space. You'll want the fans going to keep mosquitoes away but I always forget smokers exist around here. Le sigh. 

After dining at the table we sat in the cute lounge area and the furniture is adorable. So much so, I took pictures to get replicas. 

Jerk chicken was appropriately spiced. 
Shrimps are not popcorn but nothing large. They are battered and the sauce was good. Has a tang of sweet and bitter with spice. I miss fried shrimp so much that I would have ordered 2 servings if I didn't already start the smorgasbord. 

Check my pictures for costs, plating and know they'll be busy at night so be prepared to wait for service or write out your entire order as I did to help move things along. Pacing for food delivery was better than the average competitor in the area but a tad delayed at this price point. 

Definitely would recommend with a cautionary note that service is overwhelmed with the patron count & area they cover so prepare to wait.More",35,January 2022,3.5

ikebunord,Excellent Meals with Great service!!!,"Being the kind of person that I am, when visiting a restaurant I always look forward to maintaining a low key irrespective of my status, where eyes won't be focused on me, it was nice to see the height of professionalism in terms of service...I enjoyed @ NOK yesterday, 
The spicy cornbread and chicken suya was the icing after tasty AMALA MEAL,

Sophia B,Food was disgusting and they stole 100 USD from me,"Two weeks ago I had dinner with three people at NOK. The food was horrible - the ‚Äûlobster‚Äú wasn‚Äôt a lobster, the meat was chewy and old, the sauce had a disgustingly tingy stench, the chicken was dry and sad. But that‚Äôs not the reason...why I am writing this review. The reason is theft. After we had our horrible meal - again I cannot stress this enough, three out of two main dishes were proper disgusting, one was okayish and the starters were an insolence - we paid with our credit card. The bill was 200 USD for four people, we split and paid 100 USD for two. I gave the waiter (who was nice, but very badly trained) my credit card. He swiped and told me it hadn‚Äôt gone through and that we had to do it again. I didn‚Äôt mind. I wasn‚Äôt surprised that the POS didn‚Äôt work properly in this restaurant. The waiter swiped again. This time, he told us, everything was fine. When I checked my credit card statement the next day, it showed that NOK had double booked my card. Turns out it did work the first time, the waiter just decided to take money from my card twice. I contacted the restaurant and explained the issue to the manager. I though ‚Äòhey your food might be disgusting and your entire menu a pretentious overprice joke, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that you would steal from me.‚Äò Turns out I was wrong. Not only did the manager react in a very unfriendly manner when I told him his waiter had stolen 100 USD from my card, until this day, NOK has not given back the money they stole from me. I have written them dozens of WhatsApp messages, I have given them my banking details, I have sent them a copy of my credit card statement - and still: nothing. NOK‚Äôs so-called manager even admitted that they had stolen my money - he asked his bank and they confirmed that they had taken double the amount I was supposed to pay from my card - but that didn‚Äôt lead to them transferring me my money back, let alone apologize for their grave mistake. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I don‚Äôt live in Lagos - otherwise I would have called the police by now. I am back in Europe and this restaurant stole from me. I would have never written a review about their disgusting food and ridiculous service, but this is too much. I cannot quietly accept a restaurant stealing 100 USD from me - this is simply too outrageous. This is criminal.More",10,June 2021,3.5

Tammy210,Lovely spot,"I had brunch here with friends and we found it to be pleasant. We all enjoyed the meals we had and the waiter was attentive. As it was afternoon, there were flies, so he offered to burn coffee which actually kept the flies away...we learnt...a new trick.
