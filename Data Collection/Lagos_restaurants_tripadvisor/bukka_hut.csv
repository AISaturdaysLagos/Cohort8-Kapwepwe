414blessingo,THE WORSE FOOD EVER..... RUN OOOO,"It was a delivery on a Wednesday Morning 

The rice was stale and tasteless with spoilt sausage, which made me nauseous and the plantain was refried with bad oil, equally tasted horrible üò´. The chicken was a complete disaster and has obviously been left in...the store for weeks, it wasn't fresh nor tasty one bit. All I wanted was a nice meal for breakfast but I got an awful meal after paying the sum of 3900. Ordinary dodo could not be made well thoughtless of chicken and jambalaya rice. It was so bad I had to give it to my sales girl and she threw it away. It is really painful because I was advised against patronising Bukka Hut and now I know why. I have informed my staff to equally spread the news of how you deliver spoilt food to customers. To imagine this was my first time and I just wanted to have a good time with a great breakfast. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED FOR CHOOSING BUKKA HUT.More",45,May 2022,3.5

missmomoh,RUN!!!,"I experienced the worst services ever, I am stil shook!!!  Other customers couldn‚Äôt believe it too. Her name lady is ‚ÄúANGELA‚Äù, She had flu and sneezed in the rack of cutleries, told her to get it fixed, she won‚Äôt she said the sneeze was at...the edges of the tray rack and it was fine.

She lied to me that ALL OF THEIR POS is set to default and had no options of selecting account type (savings or cheque accounts), I saw more than 4 POS terminals, she said they were all same. I complaining bitterly about how they would set all to default inconveniencing the customers. The other customers behind me on the queue were also saying it was a silly idea to have all of their POS not giving debit options of type of account.

My SMILE and MTN data devices had network fluctuating from ‚ÄúNo service‚Äù to ‚ÄúLimited service- one bar‚Äù. 
 Angela with some other staff watched me for over 18minutes struggling to log on to my internet banking to transfer funds from one account to another since they lied they do not have POS that allows you to pick which account to debit. 
They were supposed to offer free WiFi to customers but she said that too was not available. 

After I successfully transferred the funds, I discovered she was lying, they had at least 3 other POS terminals that gave options of choosing which accounts you would like payment debited to. A customer watching the drama actually dumped his food, he was irritated and disappointed, they claimed they had no manager. 

I took some drugs and needed to eat, I was already pissed, I left there very angry. How do humans treat another humans this way, I usually don‚Äôt write bad reviews but what I experienced yesterday was horrendous. Imagine how many customers would contract FLU from same lady.More",10,March 2019,3.5

Luca R,Good Nigerian food,I had the best Nigerian lunch in this place that doesn't look particularly appealing from the outside. I recommend amala with ewedu soup and fish or beef. It looks weird but tastes very good! I loved it so much I went back twice.,50,May 2018,3.5

bunmiOdez,Modern Nigerian dinner (Bukka),"I have been to Bukka hut more than 3 times. I go mostly for Suya (Nigerian grilled meat).
Their menu is good and the foods taste great. They need to expand as the place has serious parking issues and the place gets crowed in the...evenings.
Its good value for your money if you really want Nigerian dish.
And oh they also have a bar session where you can hang out for drinks.More",30,December 2017,3.5

detheboy,Good Food,"Came here for dinner after work. The food tasted quite good nothing extra, but with classic Nigerian food there isn't much space for much extra. I did however feel the queue was a bit too long. The ambience also wasn't that welcoming didn't feel the...urge to sit back and relax. But on the whole the food tasted great and the serveice was not badMore",50,August 2017,3.5
tokunbo g,"Well seasoned dishes, freshly prepared","I love the fact that you could see all the food displayed in a hygienic surrounding, the food tasted very fresh and delicious.
