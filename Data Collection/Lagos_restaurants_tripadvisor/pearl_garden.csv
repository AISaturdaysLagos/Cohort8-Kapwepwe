NaijaBabe2016,Authentic Chinese Cuisine @ its finest!!! ü•ü üçõ üç≤,"This was either my third of fourth visit to Pearl Garden Restaurant. And even though I can't quite seem to remember how many times I dined at this fabulous restaurant, I do however recall how incredible their food was! Pearl Garden touts itself as one...of the best Chinese restaurants in Lagos, specializing in authentic oriental cuisine. It's a local favorite; extremely popular with Lagosians and expatriates as well, plus one of the number one go-to places for corporate events, wedding parties and numerous large gatherings/functions. This is unsurprising, being that Pearl Garden has a humungous 'surface area'. The restaurant is vast and expansive, with plenty of space, seating, not to mention the fact that it's a two story building. The decor is 100% oriental; with golden, ornate and intricate designs, fittings, trimmings and accoutrements. There's a big focus on the colour red, which gives it a warm and rich vibe. It's like you've been transported to Asia when you step into this magnificent restaurant! And then there's the food! üòã Pearl Garden serves up some of the best Chinese food I have ever had the pleasure of eating in Nigeria; so authentic and sinfully delicious. It also has a very convenient location; on a quiet street in the heart of Victoria Island. Service is also top notch at Pearl Garden. From the moment you walk in, to the time you leave, everyone- from the staff to the Chefs to the waiters is friendly, respectful, professional and diligent. 

We ordered DEEP FRIED PRAWN CUTLET, PRAWN SPRING ROLLS WITH MAYONNAISE as our starters. For the mains, we got SHREDDED BEEF WITH GREEN PEPPER, PRAWNS IN SWEET & SOUR SAUCE and FRIED RICE WITH SEAFOOD. For my drink, I got the PUNCH D'SPECIAL. This is a mocktail made with a mix of orange juice, red grape juice, lemon squash and grenadine. As was to be expected, everything tasted absolutely delicious, especially the Prawn Sweet & Sour, which is an all-time favourite of mine. The sauce was sweet, tangy, sticky and velvety- just how I like my S'n'S sauces! üòã The Fried Rice was cooked to perfection, with generous amounts of various seafood chunks. The Shredded Beef was packed with so much 'soy-saucy' flavour, and the crunch of the green peppers and onions added to the dish's goodness. The Prawn Spring Rolls were fried to a golden brown, lovely colour and were so sumptuous, as were the enormous Prawn Cutlets. I also enjoyed the Punch D'Special mocktail. It was a tad bit sweet, a tad bit bitter, and a tad bit tart, yet very refreshing. 

Pearl Garden Restaurant is definitely a place worth visiting if ever your in the mood for an eatery that specializes in authentic Chinese cuisine. There isn't a single thing I would change about this restaurant, however, I would like to see a complimentary treat provided to customers, either before or after your meal, which is commonly customary in many Chinese restaurants. It just seems appropriate for a restaurant of this class and calibre. For example, a bowl of Prawn Crackers as you wait for your order, or some Fortune Cookies or freshly cut oranges with cherries after you finish eating would be nice. Hope this isn't a stereotype and won't be open to a negative interpretation! üòØ But I would also expect complimentary Nachos at a Mexican Restaurant or complimentary Bread Rolls at an Italian or French Restaurant or Raita/Chutneys/Dips at an Indian Restaurant. Didn't catch the name of the waiter who served us, but I'd like to say thank you to him for advising us not to order an additional dish because he said it would be too much food for us. He was right! üòÅWe could barely finish the dishes we ordered. Their portions are quite big here. Pearl Garden Restaurant stands as a testament to truly authentic Chinese fare that is one of the best places you will have the pleasure of dining at in Lagos. This place exudes finesse, class, grace, professionalism and of course, phenomenally great Chinese food. I will continue to return to Pearl Garden Restaurant because it is a paragon of excellence and the 'gold standard' for original, truly authentic Chinese Cuisine. Nobody does Chinese food better than these guys! Keep up the great job Pearl Garden! üëèüèΩ Highly, highly, highly recommended!!! üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩMore",40,April 2021,4.0

ooobabatunde,Family welcome,"I've been coming here for over ten years, haven't been in a while and so I was pleased to see they have tried to maintain standards.

johne999a,Not impressed,"Used to eat here a lot, when it was smaller and across the road. Now they seem to have totally lost the plot about what is good food and good service. Get past the stupendous price (even for Lagos) for example $20 for a small...bowl of rice, the food was very average. We order pork ribs for our 8 yo, the menu stated with spicy sauce, so we asked the sauce to be on the side... they charged extra for this. The ribs we ordered (salt and pepper, used to be delicious), came as virtually inedible rubbery lumps of meat. Only the dumplings were of a reasonable standard. 

The wine options are limited with cheap to average wine sold for expensive to insane prices (20k Naira for a wine I pay elsewhere 6k), then they added 20% service charge. The real kicker was when we come to pay, swiped the card, said approved and the POS died. The manager insisted it did not go through so tried again, same thing different POS! Finally paid in cash and found been charged twice on my card. Went back, to challenge and they just told us to talk to the bank.

Absolutely will never go again. Side note this used to be a very busy place, I tried to call before for a reservation, but the number listed was not correct. When we arrived at 830pm on a Friday it was nearly empty, this should have been a red flag.More",50,August 2018,4.0
lizzielicious,Typical Lagos Experience,"I've been here several times over the years and I've had varying experiences but will just comment on my last two visits. First visit was for a quiet Saturday lunch which went well and the waiters were very attentive; had nothing to complain about. Food...came out quickly, was very tasty and ambiance was very nice. Portions were more than adequate and we even had take away packed for us. Second visit however was on a busy Sunday night. We had reserved a particular table for 5 people but when we arrived, our table had been given out to another family. One of the people in my group was not at all happy and had to tell them off very harshly because we had gone out of our way to reserve that particular table but it seemed as though when they saw that a white family wanted our table, they gave it out. Their excuse for giving out our table was also quite lame. Anyway, so as not to spoil our evening, we had to make do with another table. Our dinner went well and they tried to make up for their earlier mistake by being extra attentive. The food came our piping hot and was delicious as usual. Big portions and we enjoyed it all. It's one of the good fine dining Chinese restaurants in Lagos that usually delivers. The service just needs to improve.More",50,August 2018,4.0
Mexgir,Sweet & sour pork,"I tried Pearl Garden because it was recommended by a friend so I had high expectations.

Waiters attitude is v poor. Service needs to be called for time and again.
At the time Lagos had literally 3 restaurants , one went out...of compulsion.
You now have a much better and nicer places to eat out .
Only the food is OK. 
OK but Overpriced! Certainly not for the ambience and service you get.
There are many better options....

Oriental hotel chinese has improved over time with nice decor...

Jade Palace is also a better option...

The service was also excellent.

It continues to rank amongst the best Chinese restaurants in Lagos. Watch out for the mayonnaise spring rolls which is one of my favourites. They also serve very good vegetarian food. Usually does not require a booking except if the party is a large number.More",50,August 2017,4.0
