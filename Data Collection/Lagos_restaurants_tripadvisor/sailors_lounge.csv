Marija P,An embarrassment for Lagos,"Great view - and that’s about everything good there is to state about the Sailor‘s Lounge. Worst pizza ever, longest wait ever. Go to another place to enjoy the view.",40,May 2023,4.0
PAULALEXGC,Good live music at a fashion lounge at Lekki,"Sailors Lounge deserves a visit when at Lekki. Nice ambient, good live music, not too costly prices but too crowded during this covid period, honestly. 
We had an issue at the door because the doorman didn't allow my husband to enter in shorts.
Another day...we could enter, now dressing long trousers but we saw other men wearing shorts there.... Weird rule then. It was only for certain clients ?? 

I enjoyed, I had a good time and I recommend it. However, the managers should keep an eye on how many people they are allowing to come into during these harsh times 

Thanks to one of the waiters who gave us a table without reservation.More",35,January 2021,4.0
IamTheBlessedOne,An embarrassment never to be forgotten,"We came to the Sailors Lounge haven been referred by a good friend. We thoroughly regret it. Never in our lives, as a couple have we been so embarrassed. 

Chairs were physically pulled out of us by a thug who apparently regularly bribes the staff,...he was half naked in scanty agbada. All these in the wide glare of the Manager and Bouncers begging him Instead. 

All we did wrong was that we ordered drinks, asked for a private table to celebrate our wedding anniversary from waiters who didn’t seem to care.

Rather than remain standing, we sat on an half empty table with vacant chairs. Only to be accosted by the thug who said he was a regular, and there was nothing he could not get away with, and since he had bought a drink on the same table, he owned the table. 

We were shocked. And just before we could make a move, he pulled the chairs on us and we staggered to avoid falling. We could have fallen into the water, we could have revenged and broken a bottle or something, but we simply paid the bill for the drinks we could no longer take. And just as we walked out, he ran out after us shouting, and threatening to beat us up.

We are just back home now, and they have effectively ruined what started as a great day. 

Thankfully, we were not stabbed or drowned by the untouchable thug at the lounge. 

Visiting Sailors lounge is at your own risk, it’s an extremely loose, unsafe and unorganized place. Ignore the packaging.More",35,November 2020,4.0
Ikechukwu O,Great Outdoors by the Sea!,"I went here for dinner with my wife and we had a great time just that the music was a bit too loud. If you want to eat fish, this is the place. I had charcoal catfish and yams while my wife had Croaker fish...and chips. Nicest and largest meal i had eaten in a long time! Nice view too but please don't seat by the boat parked by the pier, you will not have a good view.More",35,December 2019,4.0
