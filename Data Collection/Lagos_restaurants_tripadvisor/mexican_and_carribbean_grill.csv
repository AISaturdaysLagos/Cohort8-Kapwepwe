Osayomore O,Tacos,Nice setting and sincerely looks like they put in good effort to create a Mexican restaurant. The service is ok. We bought Tacos and honestly it was bland. The children could not finish their meals. But the service was nice through it all.,30,Feb-18,3,Mexican and Caribbean Grill
AdioB,Mexican and Caribbean grill,"Though the food was great, not much variety, it was basically rice with poultry, fish or beef. Did not really get that authentic Mexican or Caribbean  feel.",30,Jan-18,3,Mexican and Caribbean Grill
