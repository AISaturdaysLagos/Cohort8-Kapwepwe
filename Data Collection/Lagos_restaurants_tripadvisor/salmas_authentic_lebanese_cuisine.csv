Pierreech,Hidden Gem,"Got introduced to Salma's by a colleague and haven't stopped visiting since then. It's my go to place for middle eastern cuisine and the standard never drops. They also have quite an amazing array of desserts, worthy of mention is their ""Fried Ice-cream''. Really worth...every calorie! For traditional Lebanese meals, i'd recommened the Fattouch which i'm yet to find any better than theirs, Kafta, Tabbouleh and Taouk!

Staff were also very helpful and professional. The pool and outdoor areas also make good areas for lunchMore",50,July 2021,4.5

Travelers_Paradise1,Nice Restaurant,"This Restaurant is close to Cactus and offers a large choice range. You can order lots and cool off at their amazing pool.

673karan,Great Service/Food,"A more recent favourite to our list of restaurants to visit whilst in Lagos. Great Lebanese cuisine, excellent service and wonderful ambience within a boutique hotel by the lagoon. We prefer to sit within the air-conditioned conservatory or main restaurant. They have an outdoor poolside...service, overlooking the lagoon, but it could be humid and not much to see in the dark. The Senior Manager, Bernard, ensures his guests are well looked after.More",40,January 2020,4.5

PitiI,Excellent food and decor,"Salma's is probably the nicest looking restaurant I've been to in Lagos so far.  It has a modern interior, and their place settings are beautiful.  The food is amazing.  I think it could be the best middle eastern food I've eaten anywhere.  The hummus and...baba ghanoush were excellent. The house made bread is amazing.  We asked for seconds of the bread.  We had a number of other small plates to start as well, all were pretty good.  We split a shish taouk which I have to say was the best chicken I've eaten in Lagos.  The service was excellent depending on the staff I think.  We had a couple of servers and there was obviously one server who was much more experienced than the other.   Service in Lagos can be a little awkward in general but that was not the case at Salma's.  I would highly recommend coming here.More",50,November 2019,4.5
