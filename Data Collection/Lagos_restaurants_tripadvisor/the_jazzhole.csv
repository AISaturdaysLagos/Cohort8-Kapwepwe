Dher5,Loved this place!,"Absolutely loved the Jazzhole, full of atmosphere, very friendly staff and delicious cakes/drinks! Would love to return when they have an event on!",45,Feb-20,4.5,The Jazzhole
Lischen_Mueller32,Daytrip to booklover-heaven,"Used my trip to the Jazzhole as a way of saying comfy and safe while my friend went to the market - and it was more than worth it! They have a huge and diverse (you wouldn't believe!) collection of all kinds of books from...novels to history to cooking and art. Was lucky to find two short story collections about Lagos there - and almost finished both of them while munching on two pieces of the famous carrot cake (absolutely delicious and worth all the comments!).
Take your time when coming here as the books are scattered and only roughly sorted - and for just enjoying one of your purcharses while you listen to some Jazz! 
The record collection is also huge - was just more into the books.More",40,Oct-19,4.5,The Jazzhole

I think you get the point... I’m assuming it’s first and only of it’s kind in Lagos, Nigeria
I was in book heaven!!!",40,Dec-18,4.5,The Jazzhole
Johnny-be-Good17,Very nice store but too expensive,"It is a bookshop and record store, not really a restaurant. Although you can get some drinks and snacks.
I would especially recommend this place for some crate digging and i was told that it is the best bookshop in Lagos. Sometimes there are also...lectures and other events of different artists. 
All in all a great place, but the prices are very high. The books will cost usually twice as much as you would have to pay at other shops in Nigeria. Still worth it, but keep that in mind!More",50,Aug-18,4.5,The Jazzhole
mstphy,Who Would Have Expected,"I went to Jazz Hole for the first time to see a movie. The Uber passed by it twice before my friend saw it.  Lots of records and CDs. So many books! Some old, some new. Very cool. Carrot cake and drinks at the back....The movie was good, but it was 45 minutes late beyond the advertised start time. The regulars seemed to know this would be the case and started arriving 30 minutes late.  The chairs were hard. The AC was on, but it was pretty warm.  N1500 for a 4:30pm (really 5:15pm) movie, so no need to rush to get there on time; plan to be late. If you're shopping for books, this is a great find.More",50,Apr-18,4.5,The Jazzhole
chris m,Dope!,"What  an ambient place to be in. If books and music is(are) your thing, then you absolutely need to pay this place a visit.

Colin N,Surprised to find this place!,"This small place is packed wall to wall with books, and music, vinyl and CDs. It has a great atmosphere and is like an archive of African music with old posters and information. There are a few tables and chairs at the back where you...can enjoy a decent coffee. Interesting music is playing all the time. Definitely a place to visit and to take young people to teach them about their musical heritage.More",40,Oct-17,4.5,The Jazzhole
foluke2016,THE place: a grungy ambience for bookworms and music lovers alike!,"Browse through books or even read them whilst enjoying  different background music from jazz to afrobeats, sipping away at your coffee or tea, maybe savouring a carrot cake!  
Spoilt for choice -  vinyl or CDs, paperbacks or hardbacks, international magazines...... also hosts live events, now...that is something!
Parking can be a bit of a challenge though if you don't have a driver. 
Staff is pleasant, but not very well informed regarding books available and prices.
Have been there several times and have recommended it to my expatriate friends as an insider tip! 

Would not call it a restaurant and do not feel it should be referred to as such!More",40,Apr-17,4.5,The Jazzhole

saxxin-,Nostalgic!,"Jazzhole bears nostalgic memories of a once bustling outlet for Jazz buffs like one. Been here a couple of times over the years and have noted the steady decline and absence of prized stuff. Okay, that cannot be disconnected from a once bubbling national economy....There are a couple of books and literature but I really have to source contemporary CDs and DVDs of Jazz music when I travel out!More",40,Feb-16,4.5,The Jazzhole
