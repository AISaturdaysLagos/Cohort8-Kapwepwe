itsdenalu,Worst hotel to stay in Lagos!,"I was very disappointed with this hotel, for the amount of money I paid, the place is not worth it. The room is old, the carpet in the room is so dirty and smelling!

I checked in at the Eko Hotel and Suites on April...3, 2021, the first room they give me as soon as I entered the place is smelling like a pee! I calles the Room Service- my first call the woman who answered the call said she will send someone in the room, after 40 mins no one come. So I called again and no one came to the room again. Third time I calles she said I should call the dury manager. I called the duty manager and after an hr someone came and  put as to another room- the whole process took us almost 3.5 hrs! 

We ordered for dinner- it took them more than 1 and a half he to bring the food and their white rice is terrible too! 

The bext morning i ordered for breakfast- the food came, but it is not complete, the bread did not come, the mushroom and ham were not served!!! We called room service and it took them an hr to bring the remaining food and ofcourse something is missing again. They just dont get the right thing the first time!

This is the worst hotel i experience in Lagos, I paid $350 for 2 nights and that money can get me a more decent hotel in Lagos.More",40,April 2021,4.0

FearlessBrum,Excellent hotel in Lagos,Spent two nights here recently whilst on business in Nigeria. I was actually working in rural Nigeria but spent two nights in Lagos at Eko to attend business meetings. To arrive at Eko was bliss as the room was superb and the amenities top notch....I had a couple of drinks at the bar near the pool before deciding to eat in the Thai restaurant. Overall my stay was excellent value with extremely reasonable rates. I will definitely come back to this hotel. Highly recommendedMore,40,June 2019,4.0

jan v,"Great location, but rooms need refurbishment","The hotel is very well located one a nice, big and well secured compound. The pool area and bar are really nice for get together s. 
The hotel is a bit 80‚Äòs styles and the rooms good use an upgrade. In my case the room...was not cleaner properly as I still found used soap and missing towels and water bottles in the room. Als the rooms are a bit noisy as there a tiled floors all over combined with poor sound isolation on both window, corridor and even between floors.

Nevertheless I had a good sleep; beds are good and breakfast as well. Would stay again but might prefer a newer hotel.More",40,November 2018,4.0

mrs_tatsiana,Good place but need to improve service,"Eko Hotel is one of my favorite place in Lagos, I like pool side so much there, pool is clean, comfortable for kids and adults. Nice environment around, territory is clean, reasonable people, nice food, comfortable parking. Only one thing I don‚Äôt like there is...how waiters are working, so slow: sometimes you‚Äôll wait 20 minuets for them to bring menu, next 20 minuets to take the order etc. 
I think management needs to pay more attention on this minor issue and everything gonna be alright.More",40,November 2017,4.0
655kimk,What a Village,"The Leo Hotel & Suits is so large to qualify to be called a village. It has a variety of accommodation options a settings to suite all. There's also many restaurants to choose from a s the famous pool side featuring great shows. 

The one...downside, probably due to its size, is a somewhat lack of personalised service.

Otherwise the rooms are very comfortable, breakfast great and meals sumptuous. It's nice and quiet in the rooms.  Location is good. It's a bit far from the airport though.More",40,September 2017,4.0
