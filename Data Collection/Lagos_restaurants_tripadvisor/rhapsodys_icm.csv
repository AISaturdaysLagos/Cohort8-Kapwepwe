oyinlolao2018,Good Lunch,Nearly made it to 4 stars but the service was very slow and not correct (wrong sides) and the place is either too cold when the ACs are blowing or gets stuffy very quickly. The food was good besides the squid that was cooked to...beyond rubber state. There are better choices in Lagos.More,35,May-19,3.5,Rhapsody's ICM
Shuga K,Rhapsody Blues,"Had lunch on a stressful day visiting office sites around Ikeja. My colleagues and I didn’t want to do fast food so we stopped here. 

Lunch was good with a cool ambience. There were few people in there so it was quiet.

Food was meant...to take 20minutes but it took almost double of the time, which means if there were lots of  customers it might have taken longer. Or maybe it’s what we ordered. There were no smoothies so I had to go for something else.

The bathroom was clean. 

Good place over all.More",30,Mar-19,3.5,Rhapsody's ICM
darrenw226,Food was good but drinks disappointed,"Rhapsody Blues.

Took the Mrs out for dinner at Rhapsodys Bar and Lounge Ikeja Mall and we ordered for a sumptuous meal of Prawns and potato wedges, avocado and prawn salad, pan grilled fish and potato wedges, Mrs had tonic water with lime wedges and...I had a cocktail simply known as the barmans speed rail....very potent mix i dare say.

We had a lovely time wining and dining and it would have ended beautifully so but Rhapsody had to ruin our night when we requested for our bill and they said we couldn't use their POS machine...the only solution was to waddle downstairs like an overfed penguin escorted by the bouncer in tow like a zoo keeper, so me, him and Mrs Kayne had to go to the atm machine downstairs where i withdrew money to settle our bill. They should have informed us from the get go.

Very upset right now and i wont be eating there ever again.

They may have eye pleasing aesthetics but their service tonight is disgraceful, my Mrs is upset with me cos i stopped her from making a scene.

Even more upsetting is learning that they did it because they needed cash to pay their staff salary, so our dining experience was ruined because Rhapsody decided our dining fee would be used to offset staff salary.

They just lost my respect and patronage.More",35,Nov-18,3.5,Rhapsody's ICM
gaziedecker,This is for the night out,I went to Rhapsody's for the first time. I had a starter (chicken spring rolls) and enjoyed it. I asked for Tequila Sunrise and I was very disappointed they used an orange fruit drink instead of fruit juice. This left it very tepid and watery....They charge enough for drinks; surely they could have juice and not the watery fruit drink.More,10,Sep-18,3.5,Rhapsody's ICM
T-Africa2000,Food and service were awful,The vibe is great for a night out; Rhapsody's is one of those places that's been around for a while but still manages to pull a crowd. I don't think cocktails are that awesome... they are alright... but music is good.,30,Sep-18,3.5,Rhapsody's ICM
Nnamdi101,Good food,"This might be a fun place to drink and watch sport but for a quick lunch it's dreadful. My waitress was shocking. Unfriendly and aggressive. I ordered the half chicken with peri peri sauce and chips. It tasted like chicken boiled in water and slapped...onto the grill for two minutes. Not a hint of any sauce. When I asked about it, the waitress proclaimed it to be a peri peri chicken and that was the end of it. Horrible joint.More",40,Jul-18,3.5,Rhapsody's ICM
