Dreamer50943464313,Victoria Islands Most Fun Bar/Restaurant,"If you are looking for a good value, friendly bar style dining experience, then there is none better around than Shades.",40,October 2023,4.0
irishboy4,An excellent place to chill,"This is a gem of a place to visit. The real Bature Ale, brewed locally with hops from Kent is superb, the fish & chips is better than you would find in England as is all the food, multiple sports screens allowing any sport to...be watched, ample parking outside, great atmosphere inside. It’s like British Pubs used to be, which is no surprise as it’s run by Andy from Lancashire who is a professional publican.      Go for a quiet drink or mix with the eclectic regulars, no where in Lagos beats it. The Monday night Quiz starts at 7pm where you can join a team or bring your friends along. Shades is recommended any day or nightMore",50,September 2022,4.0
Sam G,Not good,Very Slow food service. Food not good and not what was discrribed on the menu. Hostess never even walked over to me to welcome me and see how was doing. Place was empty yet waited 30 minutes for a smallo order of Luke warm nachos....Don't recommend!More,50,August 2022,4.0
nkechinyelujanen,Poor service failure,"My first time here

Worse customer service ever. I keep calling the waitresses to buy drinks. I mean 4 different waitresses inside the bar and they’ll just say I’m coming and never came back. I’ve waited for almost 30mins but none would attend to me....Like ur money is not white. The ladies would only serve the white and the Indians.!!
This is not a racial cheap talk. I’m talking from my observations. Only the white man inside the bar that was busy attending to customers also the black young guy who responded to me nicely.
I will NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO A VISITOR !!!!!

babswillz,Pub Grub Spot,"Cold beers. Decent pub grub. Loads of friendly women. It's quite a lively spot actually. If you want a night out kinda feeling without hitting a night club, this is it.",10,October 2021,4.0

Dupri00,Nice bar,"Nice bar in Victoria island with a large retinue of drinks and meal options.

Offers a sit in and a somewhat covered sit out. Typically prefer to sit out when it is not that hot and humid in Lagos.

Parking can be a problem as...there is not that much space for parking. Service is great and there is a lot of attention to detail. Saturday nights are very cool with a live band. Lots of expatriates visit the bar and so also do ladies who want to have a good time. 

Overall it is a nice place to hangout with friends.More",40,March 2018,4.0
Cetinst,Bringing In My Bzzzday The Right Way,"I decided to celebrate my birthday in Lagos this year and of course last minute me decided tho have a small birthday part gathering. I went on a quest of finding the perfect venue that had a few of the things I liked for my...day. With the help of some of my Lagos peeps they introduced me to Shades Lounge. I was so pleasantly suprised , it is located in Victoria Island and easy to get to. I was put in touch with the owner via their resident MC DJ Young 2 days before my event and Elie was a pleasure to work with. He was detailed oriented and very welcoming just by our phone convo. The day of the event 2hr followed up with me to make sure everything will be in order when I arrived. 

Fast forward to my arrival, I was welcomed warmly by the staff who whisked my cake to the back kitchen and then walked me into the club where I met Elie. He was warm and the atmosphere of the space is very swank club feel witj an open flow and pretty lights. He had my VIP section already/ prepared and worked with his team to situate our order. The order came out quickly unlike other clubs where they drag there feet and act like they are doing you a favor. His staff was extremly attentive and customer service driven. I never had a moment where my needs were not met from drinks to food. The food is very yummy and well made.

The DJ was great as well playing afrobeat favorites and top #trending songs. The rest rooms were clean and fully stocked. The pictures online dint dio the club justice it is well put together modern decor with an affordable and diverse drink and food choices. If you want to have a good time in Lagos Shades is a definite place to be!More",40,September 2017,4.0
