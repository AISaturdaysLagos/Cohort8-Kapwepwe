Shawn O,Not for spicy food lovers,"Food was ok, same as ambience but the refusal to have spicy food on their menu or worse case scenario chilli sauce is a no no",35,February 2023,3.5
V812LBdanielg,"Nice place, good food, fantastic service","Cristian (the owner and chef) succeed to transform the place into a gem, the food is excellent, the service is great and the wine is selected.... 
 The VIP room atmosphere is unique, we were 13 folks for dinner and all of us were unanimously pleased...!!!!!More",40,April 2021,3.5
DidiDidz,Thursday is pasta night!,"I went on Thursday which is pasta night- pasta dish + wine or water for N4000. I opted for arrabiata, which was so lovely and tasty, as was the wine. We were given free tiramisu as the owner knew the person I was with; it...wasn’t the best tiramisu I’ve had but it wasn’t the worst either. I found it too creamy for my liking. I would definitely return to eat at this restaurant on a Thursday. The only down side is their cash machine wasn’t working; I was here on holiday and have an international card as I rarely carry cash.More",35,March 2020,3.5
EugenioD432,great food at reasonable price,"great quality in food, all good from pizza to fish, all fresh  clean place, nice people, for me one of the best place",40,July 2019,3.5
Ade703,Not bad at all,"Seems they had a name change at some point, its currently called La Taverna. 
Nice serene hangout spot which serves Chilean, Mediterranean and Spanish cuisine in addition to some Italian options like pizza and pasta. The food is good and comes out ready relatively quickly....There's both indoor and outdoor sitting and the prices are totally reasonable. I'd definitely recommend this place as a good spotMore",20,October 2018,3.5
omohunola,"Quiet lunch, perfect picture spot :)","The place is called la taverna (maybe there was a name change). Visited with a friend for lunch and had a good time. Their menu was quite scanty tho.
They gave complimentary bread and some dip. Ordered a chicken BBQ pizza (4,000NGN) and it came...in good time. Just enough cheese, thin crust and visible chicken chunks! Enjoyed it.
Their Chapman was really good too! 
The ambience is nice for a quiet lunch/date. We wanted dessert and they directed us to a bakery at their yard which was very unimpressive with nothing attractive.
P.S they have a discount for pizzas on Wednesdays for 2,500More",50,October 2018,3.5
Kosi14,Good food,"I went with a group of 5 friends for lunch. I ordered the seafood fettuccine and I loved it. The portions sizes were quite big so I got the rest of my food to go. (Thus made me so happy)
The food arrived on time...and the waitress was friendly. 
It was very hard to find the place though as there is construction work going on outside, but the inside of the restaurant is nice and cozy.
The Chapman was way too sweet, so we had to dilute it ourselves .
All in all a good and affordable restaurantMore",40,July 2018,3.5
isagarcas,Nice chilean dishes,"When i first saw the street , I thought I was in the wrong place. But once inside everything changed. We werewelcolmed by the owner himself. Very nice and warm environment. Service needs to be improved. The ladies should learn more about the dishes. The...quality and presentation of everything we tried was nice. Although it was not as warm as it should have been,the taste was excellent on both dishes. The tapas were spot on. Owner would come to the table everynow and then to check on us and food. Good job and would go again.More",40,June 2018,3.5

Ucaimaman,"Poorly manged, untrustworthy","I booked a table here for Valentine's Day, well in advance.  3 days before Valentine's they contracted me to tell me I had no table as a ""large party"" had booked.  Now I may not be able to find a table at another restaurant.  Who...does this?  Talk about poorly managed!!

Avoid this restaurant - you reservation might be cancelled at their whim.More",40,February 2017,3.5
Lez M,Sadly has gone downhill since my first visits,"We have given this restaurant a few chances recently, but it is not what it used to be.  The waitresses are sullen and slow.  The sangria tasted off.  Very little on the menu is available.  We used to love going here, but sadly it is...now off our list of preferred restaurants.  The Chef is hardly in the kitchen when we have been in.  

I hope they can get back to the old wonderful charm soon.More",40,January 2017,3.5

Lez M,A little peace of Heaven in the middle of Lagos,"This has become a firm favorite of ours.  At least once a week to go here for dinner.
