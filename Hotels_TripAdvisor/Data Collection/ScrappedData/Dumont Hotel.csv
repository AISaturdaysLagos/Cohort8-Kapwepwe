Poor Customer Service,"It was a brief stay for 2 nights. The hotel was booked through a travel site and payment was agreed to be on arrival. On arrival at check-in, I was immediately told their POS machines - about 5- were not working and I had to go and obtain cash to pay for the accommodation. The receptionist could not be concerned. It was already dark and I had to speak to a Manager to allow check-in while this could be resolved later. The bed in my room was very noisy and seemed to have problems with the spring. Their food was unreasonably too expensive that I had to drive out to look for food. The next day, the key was dropped at reception for the room to be cleaned by 3 pm. Upon return, this had not been done. I was later informed that the person in charge had closed.

Good Experience,"A good resting place for family outing or business. Warm reception, good lift, good parking space, good air conditioning, comfortable beds but rooms are a bit squeezy with too many mirrors - maybe to create an illusion of more space. The multi-purpose hall also opens into the reception, which I consider poor design. They cook well for a typical Lagos hotel. I will certainly call again. I score them 7 over 10.",Jan-17,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Feb 2017,"Abuja, Nigeria","['27 contributions', '4 helpful votes']",30,"['Value bubble_30', 'Location bubble_30', 'Service bubble_30']",Dumont Hotel
