Good Indian Food,"Centrally located. The rooms are basic, the food is exceptionally good. The hotel does not take international credit cards. I had to draw money at the ATM to pay for my stay. The staff was friendly and assisted to any requirements I had.",Jun-19,,,wrote a review Feb 2020,,['3 contributions'],30,[],Panorama Hotel & Restaurant

Delicious Indian & Thai Cuisine Restaurant.,We made a visit on 23 July 2017 being Sunday for Buffet Lunch. To our surprise the venue has turned out to be a ocean of aromatic taste one could imagine. the flavors indeed will keep you salivating though every dish has its own different unique taste and all holds a Wow! factor. Typically as seen in other Indian Buffet the taste is merely similar but at Panorama Restaurant one can enjoy a Tasty Clean and a very hygienic food. Also the Bar holds a wide range of Alcohol's and the service is Excellent as experienced on Drinks as served. Keep It Up ! & maintain the same Taste Panorama!,Jul-17,Traveled with family,Food is Very Good !,wrote a review Jul 2017,,"['7 contributions', '2 helpful votes']",40,"['Location bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_40']",Panorama Hotel & Restaurant

Okay types. Budget friendly buffet.,"Tried the buffet. The vegetarian chaats were good - particularly the innovative jhun jhun ka chaat  . Non-veg Starters were so so types. The mutton was soft and good. Nothing extraordinary. The highlight was the mango aam panna made with fresh raw mangos, without the flavour of artificial concentrates or preservatives.",Jun-17,Traveled with family,,wrote a review Jun 2017,"Adelaide, Australia","['779 contributions', '88 helpful votes']",30,[],Panorama Hotel & Restaurant
