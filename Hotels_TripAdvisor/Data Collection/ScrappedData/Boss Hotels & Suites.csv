Excellent value,Everything was perfect. The hotel was brand new with very up to date facilities for business and leisure. Excellent value for money. I'll definitely be coming back when next in Lagos.  P.S. be sure to try out the bars. Great ambience at the upper bar during the weekdays and lots of fun at the VIP bar downstairs during weekends.,Apr-21,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Apr 2021,,['8 contributions'],50,"['Value bubble_50', 'Service bubble_50', 'Sleep Quality bubble_50']",Boss Hotels & Suites
