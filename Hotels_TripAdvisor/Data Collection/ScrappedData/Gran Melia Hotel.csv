Very good,"Stayed for three days on a business trip. The apartment is clean and food is good. The pricing of the hotel is in sync with the service, so don't get the feeling you're paying so much for little. The location is good for those who have business in that axis of Lagos.",Aug-17,Traveled on business,,wrote a review Aug 2017,,['2 contributions'],40,"['Location bubble_40', 'Cleanliness bubble_40', 'Service bubble_40']",Gran Melia Hotel
