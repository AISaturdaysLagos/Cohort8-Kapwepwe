# ANALYSING REVIEWS OF HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS IN NIGERIA TO DETERMINE CUSTOMER SENTIMENT

## Project description
Choosing hotels and restaurants is a time-consuming process, often involving weeks of deliberation. To make informed decisions, prospective guests increasingly rely on online reviews, which sometimes contain huge volume of comments some of which may be manipulated. Our goal is to empower Nigerians in making better informed choices and help restaurants and hotels improve their services by leveraging guest feedback. This study's potential extends to diverse areas within the hospitality industry, such as tourism, travel, recreation, and entertainment.
