JusticeJoyce,Value = Good price & Good Food w/ Good Entertainment,"I must say #BRUNCH and Holiday dining is a delight here. They started an hour later for Christmas Day, but they addressed all of us. The patrons we were gifted appetizer platters to recognize us for being patient with the delayed start. 

Translation: small chops...that included snail which ain't cheap. 

Unlimited Chapman, Sparkling Wine and a whole turkey with smoked lion cut pork chops with a honey bourbon glazed were the premium meat items.
While cheeseburger slider size, various salads and delicious chicken pepper soup were offered. 

They have a great mix of Local Entrees and Western dishes as my entire crowd was appeased. 

Why 5 stars if things were late?
This is and was the 1st place that a member of management or owner checked on us a la American style to ask, ""How are things?"" To get actual feedback is a service that improves the restaurant and helps customers feel appreciated. 

The Singer with the band was wholesome and interacted well with kids and adults. Now, the cherry on this sundae is IF YOU PREPAY YOU SAVE MONEY. This can be problematic for foreigners as we can't transfer like the locals. 

They are responsive and communicative via social media. Mostly Instagram as that's how I found the place and look forward to hosting events there in the future.More",45,Dec-21,4.5,Scotch Bonnet Restaurant
adey_naija,"Great Ambience, Good Food","Nicely tucked away off Idejo St behind the Stanbic building in Victoria Island. 

Decor is modern and the space looks well run. I usually use the toilet as it gives you a good idea of how well they might be managing the kitchen space. In...this case, they passed the litmus test..not in flying colours i have to say.

Anyway they have an excellent life jazz band on the day and i hear it is weekly too. Did i hear you say that is not the main reason why you go to a restaurant...I agree with you. So to the food

The restaurant is a curious mix of style; nigerian or local, continental and some form of seafood. The key point here is that they cater to broad range of palate so there is probably something here for everyone. The most important thing in my opinion is that everyone enjoyed their meal so i can recommend the food.

The negative for me was the parking arrangement. I went with a driver so i don't know how he resolved it but there didn't appear to be too much space.

Overall, i think it is a nice, well designed and decorated space that serves a broad range of well cooked tasty meals...and good music accompaniment.More",40,Jun-18,4.5,Scotch Bonnet Restaurant

Kemi O,Great burger and best apple pie I've had in Lagos!,"I went to Scotch Bonnet with a friend. I had a burger which was amazing, it's hard to get a good burger in Lagos, but this was one of the best.
The American Apple Pie was a revelation, hands down BEST in Lagos.

Service was...friendly and nice ambience - would definitely recommend.More",40,Mar-18,4.5,Scotch Bonnet Restaurant
