Ify A,Terrible  service,There  delivery  team is so terrible.  I had a very bad  experience  dat which made me feel like I was begging for some pizza. I made a delivery  and had to wait  for over an hour. I called afterwards  just for them to tell me...I didn't place any order without an apologyMore,10,Nov-18,3,Domino's Pizza Surulere

523Sadcustomer523,Cool for Kids,"This new pizza joint obviously adds colour to the entertainment landscape of Lere and gives u better ambience compared to the crowdy open space inside leisure mall if you want to sit and have pizza. Good staff and great service. Have been on a couple...of times with my kids and they love the time with me here. My son loves to be on the terrace. my favourite pizza is the BBQ and their chicken wings is nice as well. Only snag about this is the absence of Cold Stone, which is inside the Leisure mall. Hope some day they can relocate close or inside same building like the Ikeja outlet. Parking can be a challenge on some days...I have experienced weekendsMore",40,Nov-15,3,Domino's Pizza Surulere
