Omelebele N,wonderful place,"This is my thrid experience here and the experience continues to get worse. Waited almost 1 hour today for breakfast (in a practically empty restaurant) with my family including my 87 year old mother in law. After several complaints, one out of 4 orders came...and it was wrong. I must admit the person who waited on us tried her best. I think her name is Tina or Rita. We had to leave and on the way out, one of the staff commented that we have not paid for the order that came wrong! That is the limit for me. NEVER AGAIN!!!More",20,Jul-18,3.5,Seven Eagles Spur

Tolulope F,Food was bland,"This place was swarming with flies, they ran out of fries and offered to serve my burger with rice, the service was painfully slow and even after I declined the ridiculousness of being served a burger with a side of rice, I was still billed...for it. I ordered a starter of chicken strips but ladies and gentlemen, find attached what I received. Flies had even swarmed  the meal before I had the time to make out what had been served.
