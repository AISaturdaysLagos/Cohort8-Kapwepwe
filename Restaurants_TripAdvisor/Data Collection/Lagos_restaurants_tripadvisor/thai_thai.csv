Kelly M,Definitely coming back!,"A new colleague invited me to join her and some friends for dinner here.  I wasn't sure what to expect but was so happy to have Thai food in Lagos!  The food was awesome, and especially after visiting Thailand several times I know what is...'good'.  This was truly authentic. The papaya salad and green curry were awesome and spiced perfectly to my liking.  And yes, the restaurant even has Tiger beer. It was a great night with friends/colleagues. Thank you Thai Thai.  I'll be back.More",50,Aug-21,5,Thai Thai

jaxlondon2016,Best Pad Thai,"This restaurant is on the second floor of an ordinary apartment block behind security gates. You would not know the restaurant was there until they opened the door and let you in. There you see a hip and modern restaurant. The  very friendly and helpful...owner explained that they grew their vegetables in their own farm. Whatever they did, the prawn pad Thai I had was nothing short of fabulous. 

Hard to find but worth it.More",50,Apr-19,5,Thai Thai
