abboudhiba,Perfect date,"I had heard so much about Izanagi when it first opened up some years back. There was a lot of hullabaloo about a fine dining sushi place that had opened up in Lagos, and I have looked forward to trying it ever since. The reviews...were great, yet I never got an opportunity to dine at Izanagi whenever I came to Lagos until now. Izanagi is part of The Blowfish Group. This 'business entity' prides itself in bringing ""hospitality and leisure"" of high, international standards to Lagos State. The Blowfish Group comprises of La Veranda Italian Cuisine Restaurant, The Purple Restaurant, 9-7 Supermarket, Mashawi Lebanese Grill, The Blowfish Hotel, Velvett Grill and Lounge and Izanagi Japanese Restaurant of course. These establishments seemed to mostly be located on or around the same street, in a quiet part of Victoria Island.  Great location I must say. 

Izanagi is your 'one stop shop' for authentic Japanese cuisine. The restaurant's sign/logo- (from the outside), advertises ""sushi, teriyaki, teppanyaki & noodles"". It's located on the second floor, and one of the other Blowfish Group's restaurants is situated on the first floor, (Vellvet Grill and Lounge I think). Izanagi's decor was done in an elegant Japanese theme, extremely posh and impressive! The restaurant had plush, mostly teal, rich purple, green, yellow and gray chairs, done in a classy, contemporary flair. It had light wooden floors and I loved the occasional imagery of vibrant Geishas inside and outside the restaurant. Tables were made of solid, dark marble. Izanagi had an open kitchen, and it's always pretty neat to be able to catch a glimpse of the restaurant's Chefs working their 'culinary magic' behind the counter! 👨🏽‍🍳

There was a sizeable outdoor seating area right by the entrance. Izanagi's interior had an interesting combination of formal and informal seating arrangements, which I thought was really cool!🤩  It was like a series of mini living rooms, casual bars, cozy diners,  etc scattered all over. It seemed that you could pick and choose the sort of 'mood/setting' you wanted feel when you dined here. Izanagi oozed flair, class and sophistication, yet was casual, all at the same time. The restaurant is really beautiful, excruciatingly clean, well maintained, and ambiance is 'off the chain'! ⛓🙅🏾‍♀️ Their toilet was spotless and had a fancy, modern, grey marble sink- (refer to my posted pictures). 

So now, on to the food!🍴Izanagi's menu is quite varied. The hard copy menu was glossy, colorful and had a picture of just about every food item listed. The drinks & beverages were featured on an iPad. They had Salads, Soups, Starters, Soup (cooked), Robatayaki, Dumplings, Tempuras, Dumplings, Soba Noodles, 'Special From The Grill' options, Rice, Sashimi, Izuzukuri, Nigiri Sushi, Hozo Maki, Ura Maki, Gunkan Sushi, Crispy & Panko Ura Maki, Zumo Maki, 'Special' Izanagi, Temaki, Desserts and so much more! The choices were so vast, that I had a hard time making my final selections! 😄 For the sushi, I ordered CRISPY SHRIMP (breaded shrimp & sakano sauce), IZANAGI ROLL (shrimp, crab, eel, togarashi), PLANTAIN MAKI (tuna, cream cheese, plantain, chives, crispy tempura) and TEMPURA HAND ROLL (ebi tempura, cucumber, garlic mayo). For my mains, I went for the CALAMARI TEMPURA (tender strips of calamari lightly dusted and fried, served with a side of salt, black pepper & a spicy dipping sauce) and IZANAGI FRIED RICE (chicken, shrimps, assorted vegetables). My drink was a mocktail called BERRY CAIPIRINHA (mixed berries, limes & apple juice). For dessert, I got the TEMPURA CHEESECAKE (cheesecake fried in tempura batter and drizzled with Izanagi's caramel, chocolate and strawberry sauce), though I declined the chocolate sauce because it tastes bitter to me sometimes. 

The Crispy Shrimp, Izanagi Roll and Plantain Maki were really good! 😋 As good as you would expect sushi to be in a professional, legit Japanese food outlet such as Izanagi. The ingredients were fresh and on point! 👌🏽 The Tempura Hand Roll was nice, but the seaweed that it came wrapped in was dry and lacked that soft, sticky consistency that quality, fresh seaweed is known for. The Calamari Tempura I found to be too bland, though it had a delicate, chewy texture and was fried to golden perfection. I honestly expected a tad bit more flavor, although it was served with miniature saucers of rock salt and 2 other dipping sauces, so perhaps I was expected to dip the calamari in them to enhance/add to the flavor??? The Fried Rice was disappointing. It was rather tasteless, and even adding my own special home-made, dry chilli spice to 'jazz it up' couldn't 'redeem' it whatsoever. It looked so much better than it tasted. This rice looked incredible live and in print- (refer to the photo I posted). The rice's chicken- cut into chunks were way too big. They looked dark, (like bits of beef), and had that 'been in the freezer for too long' taste, which is tantamount to an ingredient not being fresh. The shrimps in the rice on the other hand were delicious, juicy and succulent. Isn't Japanese rice cooked teppanyaki style? This cooking method usually makes what is cooked packed with lots of flavor. Overall, I didn't enjoy this dish. My Berry Caipirinha was great! It was fruity and refreshing. It was served in a mason jar and filled with whole mint leaves and garnished with lemon slices and a strawberry. This yummy mocktail looked so appealing and too pretty to drink; (check out the picture of it that I posted) 🍹😍 

Last, 'and certainly least'- the Tempura Cheesecake. The waiter that tended to me told me that the cheesecake in this dessert was stored in the freezer, then fried in tempura batter- which I knew of course. I've had Tempura Cheesecake on a number of occasions and I know it to be sinfully delicious; a luscious, delectable marriage of hot and cold, 'sweet' and 'savory', smoothness and crunchiness. Izanagi's Tempura Cheesecake was atrocious! It was grainy, lacked any creaminess and tasted like it had been made with saccharine, aspartame or one of those low-calorie artificial sweeteners. And on top of that, it also tasted like a semi bitter medicine. It was also frozen rock solid, therefore too hard to be cut by my metal utensils! The tempura batter that enveloped the cheesecake was crispy and crunchy, but it couldn't 'salvage' the horrible cheesecake within! 😫 This is afterall a Japanese Restaurant, so I would expect them to whip up an excellent tempura batter. 😉 Because I had been informed that the cheesecake came directly from the freezer, I gave it a few minutes to 'thaw' a little, but nevertheless, it was still frozen when I tried to eat it many minutes later. This turned out to be a tedious task and I had to go, so I simply gave up and left a huge chunk of this hot 'n' cold mess uneaten! The Tempura Cheesecake looked divine though, 😍 (refer to the picture I posted). It gave a whole new meaning to the phrase 'looks can be deceiving'! The fact that I didn't consume the cheesecake in it's entirety seemed to bother the restaurant's Supervisor, (who I'll talk about later). It's such a shame because I've had many a delicious Tempura Cheesecakes in the past, and was so looking forward to this one, being the 'sweet tooth' that I am. 

The service at Izanagi is worth mentioning. The waiter that served me was AFEEZ. Though polite and knowledgeable about the menu, Afeez was just about the most lifeless and dull restaurant employee I've ever encountered. He had a permanent deadpan expression plastered across his face the entire time I was at Izanagi. Nevertheless, he did seem to do his job to the best of his ability. At the tail end of my meal, along comes CHRIS. Chris was Izanagi's Supervisor. He was great! Super friendly, courteous and diligent. We chatted a little and he told me that the restaurant has been open for exactly 9 years. Can't believe it's been that long since I started hearing all the commotion about Izanagi! He also told me Afeez was new; so perhaps this 'newbie' was yet to 'break into his job'. Prices at Izanagi are reasonable; at least according to Lagos standards. Though from everyone's experience- (I'm sure), every bill tends to somehow 'add up' when you order multiple items from any menu. As my luck would have it, I coincidentally ran into a relative who was dining there with a friend, and I was informed by Chris that he had settled my bill before he left! 👏🏽 Therefore, I have no idea how much I would have paid since I ate 100% on the house! 🙅🏾‍♀️

So, my 'culinary adventure' at Izanagi turns out to be  mediocre at best. I guess this place didn't 'live up to the hype'; at least for me. Thank heavens I didn't have to pay for this meal! 😂 The Fried Rice was a big let down, as was the overly brittle seaweed of the Tempura Hand Roll; and don't even get me started on the 'monstrosity' that was their Tempura Cheesecake! 😩 The sushi was really good, (as it should be), but I can't necessarily say that Izanagi is exactly the 'gold standard' for Japanese cuisine, most especially since they screwed up a Fried Rice! 👎🏽Service, (with the 'polar opposite' demeanors/personality's of Afeez and Chris), was a 'mixed bag'. Regardless of the 'lackluster' experience I had, it won't deter me from visiting Izanagi again. Perhaps I will strictly stick to their sushi next time- which seems to be their strength. Taking the entire experience into consideration, an average rating will have to 'suffice' for Izanagi. I was looking to be 'blown away' at this restaurant that I eagerly anticipated, but unfortunately, I was not. I soooooo wanted to rate them highly, but in all honesty- I just can't do that! I have to give an honest 'testament' to this eatery that I had such high hopes about. I do however have to consider the fact that this is indeed a top spot for authentic Japanese cuisine, the beauty and grace of the restaurant, the expansive menu, ideal location, great beverage and the 3 world-class sushis that I had, plus lots of other positive elements like Chris's awesome professionalism. Want to give a loud shout out to CHRIS and say a big thank you to him for his amazing service. AFEEZ needs to work on his 'dowdy' demeanor. I will hopefully return to Izanagi one day and try to sample the wide array of sushis they have. Hope they will read this detailed review meticulously and endeavor to improve upon the 'issues' I outlined on this medium. Here's hoping I will have a better experience next time!More",50,Oct-20,4.5,Izanagi
