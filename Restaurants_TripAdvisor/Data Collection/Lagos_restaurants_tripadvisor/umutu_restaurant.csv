396pankajb,Dinner @ Umutu,"One of the good restaurants in Lagos. Earlier owned by European family and now managed by native Its fantastic example of continuity.

Olumide K,Great Italian Restaurant,Umutu is a great Italian Restaurant in the Heart of Victoria Island. The food is well prepared and reasonably priced. The only challenge is parking which is a common occurrence with Restaurants in Victoria Island. Asides that the Restaurant is a good hang out spot.,35,Apr-19,4.5,Umutu Restaurant
Mzungu4Life,Unprofessional Takeaway Preparation & Packing,"While the restaurant's dine in service is generally good, their takeaway services are extremely poor.

I've dined previously at the locale and the service and quality were good, especially by Lagos standards.

However, when ordering a meal for takeaway the staff made careless and lazy...mistakes.   For some reason they poured soup inside a foil pack, intended for solid food and then covered it with a paper lid.   Obviously when it arrived it had fallen apart.   When I called the restaurant about the issue their only explanation was ""this is the one had.""  

This is a premium dining facility.  They should know to put soup in a container made for liquids.More",40,Jan-19,4.5,Umutu Restaurant

Mexgir,Seafood pasta,"The staff was very friendly and the place was nice but I had my problems with the food. We ordered a plate with ham and salami to start and then pizzas. The pizza was okay for Nigerian standards but the plate was not good at...all. The salami was old and far away from a handmade Italian salami, the bread was like the ones they will serve you in Subways.More",40,Sep-18,4.5,Umutu Restaurant
honeyc561,Awesome service tasty food.,"I think they have the best pasta in Lagos. I tried the seafood spaghetti with olive oil and it was very good, my husband tried the one with calamari sauce and it was even better. For dessert, the tiramisu is a must. The only observation...is that we wanted to try pizza and apparently, the oven wasn't working on that time. The service is good. Definitely, I do recommend Umutu.More",40,Sep-18,4.5,Umutu Restaurant

First night in lagos with no particular expectation of the place. we were WOW'd! the food was authentic, delicious, and well priced. We still can't believe we managed to find such a gem in lagos....tucked away in a serene environment it was like eating round a table in a small 5 star restaurant in the heart of rome. the staff were so welcoming and our glasses were never empty. Their gelato was SUPERB and I will personally recommend

KITTAPPA,Buon cibo ristorante,"I can be extremely picky/critical when it comes to restaurants and where I spend family time. Enter Umutu to the rescue!! Immediately you drive in, there is a certain non commercial warmth and an ambience that immediately opens your appetite before you even set eyes...on food. 
MUSIC- Enjoy a space where you can chat as music plays in the background without drowning your conversation
AMBIENCE-  Family time, Business meeting, exclusive setting or just hanging out with friends... Umutu has several areas set up accordingly for you to visit over and over.
STAFF- Staffing is an area that continues to be developed in Nigeria. The mindset of individuals in Lagos needs extreme honing- not entirely to be written off at Umutu as they are neat, respectful and provide a decent knowledge of their menu...however there is still some work to be done on a few.
FOOD- For someone whose 1st choice for food wonâ€™t be Italian, Umutu showed up and Italian food was sold to me. They have THE best spaghetti you will ever try. Every stomach deserves flavour filled meals and I truly dislike bland food. I never had to worry about this as everything I had a taste of(and I did taste a lot) was remarkable. 
DRINKS- I had heard of Radler beer which I wanted to taste and although they didnâ€™t have stock, there was an in house wine recommended to me that paired perfectly with my meal.
Umutu is a gem that deserves more recognition than it currently enjoys and I recommend it to anyone who seeks great food and service.More",50,May-18,4.5,Umutu Restaurant

olathecomedian,Nice Vibe,"Great vibe and great food.  Very polite and patient staff.  The only reason it wasn't 5 stars is because most of the desserts in the menu were out of stock and the toilets are not air conditioned, so they're very hot.",35,Nov-16,4.5,Umutu Restaurant
