Often without light working, very dark and unpleasant place. I can't even imagine to sit there and have their...food. Their  hygiene is under big question. Many things changed in Lagos,but this place seems like frozen from the last century. I can't recommended it to nobody.More",40,Dec-14,3,Frenchies Foods Limited
