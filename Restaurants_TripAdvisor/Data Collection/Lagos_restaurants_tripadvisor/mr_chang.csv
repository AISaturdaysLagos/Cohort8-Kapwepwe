Geraldattila,Not maximising its potential...,Food was good. Not the best Asian cuisine ive had though. Service was good...would come back again. But surely they could do much better with the location ...space and variety available to them. Seem too relaxed a restaurant for me...Acting like they aint no competition...in...the Asian food space. Food was good ...wasnt blown away...Prices could be better and staff could be a bit more honest on meals available. Not just taking your order and serving what they feel is okay...More,50,Jul-17,3.5,Mr Chang
Omotunde A,Mr. Chang is Dubious!,"I first wondered while I and my 3 other colleagues that went for lunch were the only one at the restaurant especially on a Saturday. I soon found out. Our bill was worth N26,500 only for us to be charged extra 5% consumption tax and...10% service charge after charging 5% VAT making 20% charge on the fee. I think the restaurant is a scam. Besides the food is just normal. I think it's not worth it. The management is dubious and unscrupulous!More",50,Mar-17,3.5,Mr Chang

mjacob007,Nothing exciting,"we went for lunch with a colleague for lunch. Despite the fact we were starving, the food was not very tasty, service was lousy. as we could not finish the food, we decided to take a doggy bag. That was every worse, not sure if...the temperature of the food and packs did not work, the food was just useless. we swore not o go back every again.More",40,Dec-16,3.5,Mr Chang
Tinuks,Good enough but a bit pricey,"The food is good, not excellent but very good. Parking is a bit of a nightmare as there are only 4 spaces in front of the building so that for me is a big minus.",10,Feb-16,3.5,Mr Chang

de_rahul,Good but spicy food,"One thing i like about the restaurant is the quality of food and the speed of service. If you r into spicy food then mr chang is your place.

There authentic chinese soups are very good (you need to mention how much spice you can...handle). Portions are also good. 

Parking can sometimes become a bit challenging though.

If you r a sea food lover, try any of their fish dishes and the prawn in black sauce.More",40,Jan-16,3.5,Mr Chang
