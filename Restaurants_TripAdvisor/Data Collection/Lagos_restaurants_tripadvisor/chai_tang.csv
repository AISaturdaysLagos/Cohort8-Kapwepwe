Excalibernono,Bad customer service,"Ordered for take away delivery.

The food was 2 hrs late.
Dish was not what was ordered and paid for.

Call to speak to manager Maria, only for the line to cut off.

Terrible customer service. Never again",35,Aug-23,3.5,Chai Tang
E7750LXjackiem,Food poisoning,"Beautiful restaurant with a great ocean view.  My husband and I ordered chow mein noodles with pork and both got food poisoning. We were both sick the entire day.  We called the management twice and left messages. We finally called again and spoke to the...manager. She said she’d look into it and call us back.  She called back and said they put something in the noodles and it will make you sick…….what???  She said you can tell them not to put it in the food next time.  OMG, who would intentionally put something in the food that makes you sick.  How would anyone know to tell a restaurant not to put an ingredient in the food that will make you sick.  No…..this is NOT an ingredient, this is FOOD POISONING!!!  We will never go there again! She didn’t even offer to comp or do anything to make it right.More",35,May-22,3.5,Chai Tang

Ayfay,Staff seem to do what they want u,"Their Food standard is just like a Chinese Fast food level. Hot and Sour soup, Corn soup and Fried rice are acceptable. However the other Chinese cuisine is terrible......Like the dim sum (Har Gau) is not fresh at all. I also tried the Crispy Duck...and Clay Pot Prawn. Honestly, these are not original Chinese food (Just use the similar name but do it in whatever way). 

Service is fairMore",35,Dec-21,3.5,Chai Tang

bunmiOdez,Yummy & lovely,"I went there today and the lady at the entrance claimed it was packed full, despite the place being extremely empty. When I asked if I could just go to the bar for drinks, She said it was an order from the bar staff not...to allow anyone there because she was the only one on duty. It was just weird… the sudden blocking of the entrance, the continuous excuses.More",10,Dec-18,3.5,Chai Tang

CSRam,Birthday dinner,"A lovely atmosphere for an official dinner. The Decor, the view of the Atlantic. Fantastic. Friendly service. Very generous with the rice, not as generous with the proteins( Chicken, Prawns etc) The whole fish dish very nice! something to try. And the long island drink...a real kicker!
