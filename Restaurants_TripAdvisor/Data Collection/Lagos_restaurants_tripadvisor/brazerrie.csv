charlesaD9225JH,Quite An Experience!,"I had the pleasure of staying at Four Points by Sheraton for a night with my wife and we had both dinner and breakfast at this restaurant......IT WAS WONDERFUL!!! 

The choices are pretty much what is expected from a high rate restaurant but what I...fell in love with is their Water Melons. Their fruit choices were absolutely exquisite.
The atmosphere that evening was lovely as the room was well lit yet subtle enough to give that elegant feel to each meal. Buffet style dinner and breakfast yet it looked specially cooked for you. 

The only down side to my experience was the breakfast chef who was making the omelets, who had the air of sheer arrogance about answering simple questions and doing his job. The line for what he was doing was quite long but his final output was worth the wait though.

The coffee choices wonderful; the array of fresh fruit juices was exceptional; the meat and chicken done right and finally the clean up was on time and professional. 

I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants good service and food choices.More",35,Jun-17,4,Brazerrie

adey_naija,Great Buffet Experience,"I ate here as breakfast was included in my room rate. I liked that they had some local food, fried plantains, etc, and there's an omelette station, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
