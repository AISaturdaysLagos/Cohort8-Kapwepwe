ManRash2,Monday Lunch,"This is my second visit after nearly 2 years. It still remains a very expensive place compared to other Chinese restaurants with great meals. The staff could have been more professional. I requested that my starter come with my friend's meal at the same time....But they declined and brought mine first. I had to insist. The meal was taken back and I'm sure reheated. They could have planned better. Frankly, but for the ambience, I know of better tasting meals in less pricey places.More",40,Feb-20,4,Jade Chinese Ikeja
