Maritha O,An awesome dinner experience ü•Ç,"Wakame restaurant at Mariott Ikeja has a beautiful and relaxing ambience and it doesn‚Äôt just stop there. The service from the waiters was top-notch as well.

 I and my friend were new to the Asian fusion scene and so, our waiter, Mr. Anthony (who I...highly recommend) pointed out some dishes for us to try out. We followed his advice and had a blast with the meals we ordered‚ú®

We had the prawn spring rolls as the starter dish. I‚Äôd rate this a 10/10. It was hot, crispy and with every bite, I got a delicious mouthful of creamy prawns. 

For our main dishes, I had the ginger beef tenderloin and Jasmin rice (9/10). The beef was tender and the sauce was really tasty. My friend had the Tandoori wings and fried rice (as a side), It came in a platter, with naan bread, pepper sauce and a fresh salad. We both had wine to finish up our meals. And we enjoyed every bit of our experience. 

P.s: It was my friend birthday and when we told Mr. Anthony, they sent to our table a slice of moist cake. 

Total bill was N50,400 (inclusive of VAT) for 2 persons and the portions were so filling, we had to pack the rest up to go.

 I‚Äôd rate this restaurant 5 stars and I‚Äôll definitely be back for another visit!More",50,Oct-23,5,Wakame Restaurant
