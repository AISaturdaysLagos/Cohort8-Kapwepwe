Travelphile2009,Quiet location - good ambiance,Quiet location- looks like a residential area.  Good ambiance indoor or outdoor.  Wide range of food and drinks and prices are comparable to similar restaurants.  Food is good and staff and management are nice.,50,Dec-19,4,Switch Lounge and Grill
NonemekCreativity,a place with great respect and service for patrons,I actually worked here some years back... I still recall that people come from main land to eat our catfish grill and pepper soup with yam or plantain inside. You have to try that too.,40,Jul-19,4,Switch Lounge and Grill
yogunrinola,Backyard Banter,"If you are looking for a cosy getaway where you would feel isolated from the rest of the world, this is the place! The sort of environment I would create in my backyard. Lovely, very chilled indoor atmosphere for those sunny days. Cool, luxuriating outdoor...experience for early morning or evening hangouts. Decent and mature clientele who, as though following a script, tone down their merriment and noise levels. Don't visit here if you enjoy rowdy spaces. My daughter wondered why there weren't any fish in the ponds surrounding the waterfalls - I said the neighborhood cats ate them!More",40,Feb-18,4,Switch Lounge and Grill
Subomi P,Nice laid back spot,"Switch is a great place to get a beer with a friend. Major premiership football matches are played on the big outdoor screen. The pricing is fair and the drinks are cold. They also have peppersoup, barbecue and a full menu. I prefer sitting outside...to sitting inside.More",40,Mar-17,4,Switch Lounge and Grill
Dupri00,Excellent Hangout,"Amazing this place hasn't been reviewed before noon. Very nice hangout in Lekki Phase One for mid working class people. Excellent food which ranges from Nigerian, West African to continental. Drinks are very chilled and reasonably priced for the environment. Soft music with a sit...in or outdoor. Indoor is more cozy but outdoor is better suited in you are in larger pairs of 4 and above.

Mature and classy crowd. Highly recommended.More",40,May-17,4,Switch Lounge and Grill
