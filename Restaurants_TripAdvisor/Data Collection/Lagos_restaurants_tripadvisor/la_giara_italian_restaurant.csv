Ruthbara,Trip of a Lifetime,"We were visiting Lagos, Nigeria for the first time. Didn‚Äôt know what to expect and we didn‚Äôt plan a full busy itinerary like we usually do. After exploring local cuisine, we wanted a taste of something familiar. We decided to try this restaurant since it...was in the hotel lobby. Philip, our waiter, made our dining experience such a pleasure. He was friendly, knowledgeable and made the best recommendations ever for our meal. 

My husband is a very picky eater and Philip listened well. He conveyed everything to the chef and the food was amazing! My husband had lasagne and the salad buffet. I had a make your own pizza. I‚Äôm sensitive to tomatoes so Phillip suggested an alfredo base which was not on the menu. He was attentive and we enjoyed the experience so much that we ordered dinner to our room the next day! Guess who our server was, Phillip! He did it again. I wanted salad, so he had them make a special one just for me and remembered no tomatoes. I asked lots of questions about the menu and even mixed and matched items from various hotel restaurants. It was delightful and the portions are big.More",50,Apr-22,4,La Giara Italian Restaurant
