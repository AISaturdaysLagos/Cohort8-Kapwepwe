LancasterTee,Okay - but definitely not great,"We ordered hummus with mince as our appetizer then quinoa salad and seafood pizza for our mains.
The service was good, waitresses very attentive etcüëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæ but the food wasn‚Äôt nice. The pizza was almost tasteless and the quinoa salad lacked stated ingredients (e.g. sweetcorn). Not...sure I‚Äôll be back here by choice.More",45,Nov-22,4.5,B.L. Restaurant
Kelly M,Order Lebanese Food here!,"I almost ordered the mixed grill but at the last moment changed my mind and ordered a pasta dish.  I also ordered the tabouleh which was very delicious!  When the pasta arrived I was looking at my friend's mixed grill and was disappointed I ordered...the pasta.  The mixed grill was definitely a better choice, but next time I will know.  The servers were attentive and helpful.  Overall a good experience, especially because we had a big group.More",45,Oct-21,4.5,B.L. Restaurant

Chris H,One of the better reataurants in Lagos,"I last visited this restaurant about 4 years ago and enjoyed it then, Since that visit they have added an outside terrace and bar as well as the 'Heineken Bar' complete with hookahs. the menu is largely driven around Bulgarian and Lebanese food, but a...number of International dishes are added based on the clientele mix. The latest additions include a number of South African dishes including boerewors and game steak which are flown in from RSA.
For our meal we stayed traditional and ordered a number of dishes to share as tapas. We enjoyed falafel, cheese rolls, calamari, hummus with flat bread and chicken wrapped in bacon. All really good. Service was friendly and efficient although a little slow. RecommendedMore",30,Feb-20,4.5,B.L. Restaurant

SophiaMike,Try the best restaurant in VI,"Where do I start? Variety, consistency, clean, good service, value, never disappointing. Been over 100 times with wife, friends, by myself. Cannot find fault. Always way way above anything else in town. And both owners are always around to listen and gist. Food for every...palate. See you when I pass through again and thanks for feeding me!More",50,Oct-19,4.5,B.L. Restaurant
Damidj,Great Bulgarian Lebanese dining experience in Lagos,"Bulgarian and Lebanese cuisine under one roof might seem like an unlikely combination, but not to worry, it's not actually a fusion of the two cuisines. The menu just has both listed separately. So you can order a delicious Chicken Sofia or you can order...a classic Lamb Kofta - you decide. I thought that was pretty unique, and don't know that I have ever been to a Bulgarian restaurant, so this was a nice introduction. 

The restaurant itself, is well located off Ajose Adeogun in VI, and very easy to find. It sits on the corner of Younis Bashorun and Tiamiyu Savage. It has a really spacious interior and some outside seating as well. There are huge TV screens and some beer brand (Heineken, Gulder) sponsorships, which make me think it works well as a sports bar also. The wait staff are plentiful and very attentive, seriously I have been there twice and it always seems they are very overstaffed for the shift. So the ladies just seem to stand there and stare, with not much to do. They are friendly though, and are knowledgeable about the menu, which is a big plus. 

Now to the food, no complaints whatsoever. You have to try to hummus with meat, it is delicious and the meat is a nice addition. In the two times I've visited, my party and I have ordered the lamb kofta, seafood platter, chicken Sofia, and a sampling of some of the appetizers. And everything has been well made. I'm starting to think this might be one of the few Lagos restaurants that have a process down pat and can deliver on consistency.More",40,Jul-19,4.5,B.L. Restaurant
