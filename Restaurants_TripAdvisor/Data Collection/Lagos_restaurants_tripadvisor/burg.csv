vincenttT1976HM,Burgers üçî and fries üçü,"- People are nice and its a nice place. Dont come here if in a rush. Waited 65 min for 2 burgers and some cajun fries. Unacceptable obviously. 
- Fries are good but portion = 1 potato (should be at least twice as much to...be honest). 
- Burger is ok but the patty is ridiculously thin, and there should definitely be more lettuce inside the burger. That would change the experience completely. Try to put some shredded lettuce instead - you‚Äôll see it will please costumers. 
- I‚Äôve never tried the smoothie bar products but they look good.
- Never had a dessert either. 
- Fun place to meet or spend 1h with some friends
- Sanitary protocol is well respected. Must say. 

Try it and make your own opinion about it. That is mine. 3/5More",25,Dec-20,2.5,Burg
omohunola,No AC and food is blehhh,"Visited this place 9months ago,  walked into a hot and stuffy space and left without ordering.
I decided to give it another try, still hot and stuffy! Had the OG burger which was fair but the pattie was on the edge of tasting off.
Vanilla...milkshake cost 2500 but tasted like baby food/milk.
Had to order takeout and eat in the car because the atmosphere was not great.
Definitely won't be going back anytime soon!More",30,Oct-19,2.5,Burg
ooobabatunde,Disappointing,"From walking in it was a huge disappointment. Usual bunch of bored, untrained staff staring at us like we dropped from Mars. They don't have coffee????!!!!!! There was no welcome, no smiles. I wanted to leave immediately but had to endure as my wife wanted...to treat us. We waited for our burgers and yes they were okay, but the service is CRAP. Burgers for 2 adults and two children came in one tray and no one had the initiative to offer additional trays. I asked for two additional trays only to discover they were soiled and dirty (the girl apologized but didn't attempt to bring new ones. The cheese fries we got were soggy and smothered in cheese (like they were trying to hide something) meanwhile it was served to us without cutlery. On Burg Instagram page it was served with a fork. Really sad, the management should consider training (I can help you) . There was an off menu burger which wasn't marketed to us at all lost opportunity to upsell. Right now I won't be recommending or coming back.More",20,Jul-19,2.5,Burg
