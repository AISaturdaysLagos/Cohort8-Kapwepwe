David M,S A L T Y,"I‚Äôve eaten here on several occasions, and even though the location, price, menu, staff and ambience are all good, the place is let down by its incredibly salty food.

Excessive use of salt in food = unhealthy food.

No-one wants to pay for unhealthy food....Please ask the chef to go easy on the salt, he/she is ruining the meals.More",50,Apr-22,4.5,Vanilla Moon
omemie,Don‚Äôt Bother,"The food was horrible! No other way to describe it. The jollof rice was basically red white rice with seasoning cubes. We were a family of 4 and all ordered different meals and no-one had anything good to say. Also the menu needs to be...tweaked, as choosing something from the menu was so hard. They also need to add an option of quarter or half chicken on the side.
However, the cocktails were really nice.More",20,Jan-22,4.5,Vanilla Moon

758stevel,The best in Lagos,"Wow this place blew us away. Admittedly my wife and I are late afternoon/early evening eaters so we practically had the restaurant to ourselves. 

We were attracted by the Tapas and because we were hungry, over ordered but every dish was simply delicious. Needless to...say we are taking the remainders home to share with family later.

The food came out quickly but timely and the service was also high quality. 

Drinks were really good, we each had 3 cocktails and all were delicious.

Overall, having been to many great restaurants in Lagos, this one tops it for     us. We will be back for sure!More",50,Dec-21,4.5,Vanilla Moon
31julieti,OH! WHAT A GREAT PLACE!!!!,"Writing this review brings back the tastes of all my experiences at 788 on the sea on Saturday 6/11/21. Everything was perfect; the food, drink, the services was top-notch! 
 The man behind the piano is heaven trained! The atmosphere is indescribable. My experience with 788...on the sea is my best diner experience in my history of restaurants!More",50,Nov-21,4.5,Vanilla Moon
Ade703,"Nice, cosy place","Vanilla Moon is a nice restaurant/hangout spot. The decor is trendy and modern and it had both indoor and outdoor sitting areas. Price-wise, it's what you'd expect from the usual island restaurant - not overly expensive but not cheap either. The staff were attentive and...responsive and the food and cocktails were on point. It's a nice setting for couple or group outings.

The only reason for my 4 rating is on the day of my visit, someone (I assume he was the manager) was showing some guests around (seemed like they were discussing either renovation details or sitting arrangements) and kept pointing directly at our table. We found this both very intrusive and inappropriate, they should've known better.More",50,Mar-20,4.5,Vanilla Moon

Dennis L,"Nice restaurant, something different in Lagos","As you may (or may not.....) know, there are many very good restaurants in Lagos. So when we heard about Vanilla moon, we checked there menu and were pleasantly surprised to see it‚Äôs quite a different menu. What immediately caught our attention whas the choise...of Tapas they offered. So this Saturday we went there with 6 friends and ordered almost all the tapas from the menu. The service was very attentive and we got all our orders at the same time. All the tapas tasted very good. Although we had quite enough, some of us also ordered a desert. And especially the Chocolat fondant was a real treat!

Based on the taste of the tapas and the overall service and experience, we would definately go their another time to taste some of the main courses.More",50,Oct-19,4.5,Vanilla Moon
petertarejr,"Beautiful Place, Good Food and Great Service.","It‚Äôs a small restaurant but one of the best in lagos. The staffs from the security officer to the waiters and manager were top notch. 
My partner spilled her drink and the swift response from the manager and a staff was very impressive. 
They replaced...the drink FOC.More",40,Oct-19,4.5,Vanilla Moon
DBVLagos2016,Best Cocktails in Lagos,"Stunning cocktails available here along with an amazing variety of starters, each more delicious than the other. Corn Ribs was my absolute favourite, quirky & innovative! The main course was not quite up to the mark and I felt also a bit pricey (fish &...chips). Definitely worth a visit, I will be returning to try other items on the menu. A welcome addition to VI nightlife!More",50,Aug-19,4.5,Vanilla Moon
