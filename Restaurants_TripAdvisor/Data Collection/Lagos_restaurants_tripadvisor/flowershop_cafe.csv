Ayo O,Sobremesa,"It was a  surprise lunch for a friend, and we chose the Flowershop Cafe for its central location and favorable review of its food.
Parking can be a nightmare in central Lagos but they have valet service that takes that burden off you.
Inside the...cafe, the ambience was delightful and the background music set the appropriate tone for the hour. The wide range of options was matched by the generous portions in which these sumptuous delicacies were served. 
However, it all came into full bloom when the headwaiter realized we were having a surprise dinner for our friend-and on own volition-sent a lit cake to our table. His team surrounded and sang us a cheery song for our friend. 

A memorable experience it was indeed, at the Flowershop Cafe.More",50,Jun-22,4,Flowershop Café
