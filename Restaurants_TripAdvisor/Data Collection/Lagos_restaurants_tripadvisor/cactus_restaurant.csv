Yousef B,Charged my twice and stole my money,"Charged me twice and stole ¬£98 from me, no email to contact for a refund. The waiter lied and said the first transaction didn't go through and made me give my card again, but then got charged twice! I want my money back.",40,Oct-23,4,Cactus Restaurant
ScenicSights,Popular Place,"Visited after church last Sunday.  Seems to be a popular place.  Clean and pleasant.  I had dundun and dodo and prawns.  Unfortunately, the only way I could get prawns on the side was to have them breaded and fried which is not what I prefer....I peeled off the breading and they were still good. The dundun and dodo were okay but not spectacular.  I had a drink with ginger in it.  My friend had a fritata.More",40,Oct-23,4,Cactus Restaurant
Adenike A,MELT IN YOUR MOUTH FILET OF BEEF,"I hadn't been to this restaurant in a while and a friend who was equally bereaved convinced me to go with him.
It was the best decision I'd made in the last ten months. 
Initially we were both at a loss of how to employ...the QR code  menu,we insisted on hard copy ones which we got with smiles....obviously these grey heads are not up to date.
We decided on an entree of fried baby calamaris and a meal of medium well grilled filet Mignon.
Wow I tell you we had our socks blown off by the deliciousness of these plates,the calamari was crisp ,hot and delicate to the palate as expected while the steak was melt in your mouth beef with the loveliest black pepper sauce and fried rice as carbs.
I went back alone on a later date to have ice-cream...my choice was lemon cheese cake flavor,I so relished it it took me a whole hour to lick just one scoop.
This is a lovely restaurant for ambience and meals......I only wished the clientele could be more considerate,there tended to be a lot of noise.More",40,Nov-22,4,Cactus Restaurant
