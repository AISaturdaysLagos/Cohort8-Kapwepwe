kamangaglamhouse,BAD MANAGEMENT,"On the 27th of October, some friends and I came to your restaurant for dinner . We were about 20 and we had paid in advance for dinner and drinks. We requested for a Buffet cause we where doing a get together celebration. 

1. Your...waiter gave us a different higher price for alcoholic drinks, wen we asked him why he was giving a different price from the menu he couldnâ€™t explain. We asked him to call the manager so she could explain what was going on. The manager was so down dress that we wondered how a manager could be dressed like that . 

2. The food was so small, that it didnâ€™t even go round for everyone. Had to call the manager again to complain about how little the food was for the kind of money we paid . 
ðŸ¤”. 

3. As we rounded up the dinner, one of the waiters came to ask if any of us was driving a sliver Jeep because some thieves had broken the window of the car . 
We all quickly rushed downstairs to check and yes it was one of our cars. 
We asked the security what had happened and they really cannot explain anything because the car was parked right next to them. They gave one lame excuse that a car drove straight to Jeep, broke the window and stole the phone inside. 
It was clear that it was an inside job, cause how did the thief know that the was a cell phone in the car.? 
We were so disappointed over everything, we all left immediately.More",30,Oct-18,3,Brown's Café and Restaurant
delebami,I had Seafood Pasta and the fish grilled of the day,"So far so good a good environment to eat and discuss, I was looking forward for a nice dinner based on fish. And there I found it, spaghetti allo scoglio and a second course of grilled fish of the day I guess was GiantAfrican aka...Shininose. In a nut shell not bad at all just ask them to go easy on the chili pepper if you don't tolerate spicy food.More",20,Jul-17,3,Brown's Café and Restaurant
