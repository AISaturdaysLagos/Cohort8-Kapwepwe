_abisheart,very disappointing,"took some friends visiting from out of town.
the first thing you notice is that the restaurant has a musty stale smell .... There were very few people there . 
Had the meat Bbq... the beef was tough and very salty, and the chicken very...fatty. The lamb was okay. The buffet of salads and sides was very mediocre, scanty and not very appetizing looking or tasting. The fried plantains were overripe and oily and the fried yams brought as accompaniment to the table , not great either.
this used to be one of my favorite haunts years ago so I was quite disappointed.
certainly won’t be back anytime soon ....More",35,Aug-19,3.5,Churrasco
Dammieabiola,Brazilian buffet,"I had the Brazilian buffet here sometime ago, it was so lovely, different types of meat, sausages were brought to our table and we could have a taste of everything, they were all delicious, the only downside was I don’t eat a lot and I...couldn’t eat up to half the selection and I still had to pay full price .More",40,Jan-18,3.5,Churrasco
Pinkjacket,The place everyone has forgotten,"Churrasco used to a hit but has lost it. The quality of services has gone down, same with the quality of the food.",35,Feb-18,3.5,Churrasco
vecksan,"If you love meat, you'll love Churrasco!","If you're a meat lover like me, then Churrasco is the place for you. I never get tired of being served different kinds of seafood, meat, pork, chicken on skewers by the waiters. It's my meat heaven!",35,Nov-17,3.5,Churrasco
sagmekzie,Meat! Meat!! Meat!!!,"It was a galore of meat all through.

There's a bar with salads and side options to go with the meat but the meat kept on coming.

Chilled out atmosphere too!",30,Aug-17,3.5,Churrasco
Midibabe,Meaty Affair!,"Lovely place by the water front, good service and if you are a meat person then you are in the right place!
All sort of meat on display with other varieties on the menu. Its beautify at night.
Had a nice experience and the drinks...from Mojitos to pina colada and other drinks are on point.More",40,Jul-17,3.5,Churrasco
munao125,The meat was the star attraction!,"Met up with some friends for a meal as one of us had come visiting from abroad. Quite happy to give Churrasco a try. I had heard about it but never actually been. The prices were a bit eye popping especially as I had promised...to pay for everyone. Service was good and friendly, the place was buzzing and had a good vibe. We settled in and had a starter salad which was a bit underwhelming as half of the salad dishes were empty. I had ordered the meat. There was also a choice of seafood. The beef was the star attraction, topside, bottom side, marinated, all on large skewers. Lovely- juicy and well seasoned. Additional sausages, pork and chicken. Servings were not overly generous but there was a lot of choice. Ultimately the waiters stopped coming and I came over a bit Oliver Twist as I WANTED MORE….Great meal, great vibe, next time, I’ll sweet talk the waiters to give me more of that marinated beef mmmm… Food was lovely but prices were very high hence an average ratingMore",20,Mar-17,3.5,Churrasco
Mmakamba B,Mmakis,"Great place, great ambience. Good dishes. Will definitely go back. The meats were excellent. The waiters are good. I particularly loved the mojitos.",50,Feb-17,3.5,Churrasco
Phearphire,"Meat, meat and more meat","Vegans steer clear as you may experience anaphylactic shock at the number of meats on offer. They offer an all you can eat style meal with or without seafood, you can even pretend to be health conscious and visit the salad bar, but your just...kidding yourself... you came for the meat ! *manly grunt* that said they have a fully stocked bar and serve all sorts of cocktails.More",40,Nov-16,3.5,Churrasco
mjacob007,Only churrascaria in lagos,"We were in Churrasco for dinner with some colleagues. prices have more than doubled, should be the devalued NGN. but $ terms, same price. Service was a bit sloppy this time. food quality also seems to have slipped. The selection of meat seemed to have...dropped, but the lobster portions were very generous. I also felt the cocktails were way too expensive.More",40,Dec-16,3.5,Churrasco
Ibadanboy,Lovely!,"Churraso is a lovely restaurant serving grilled food of all sorts - seafood, meats, etc. Lovely place with a waterfront position, good service and a great ambiance. Excellent food!",30,Mar-16,3.5,Churrasco
Omoba88,Water view,"Nice ambience, I don't drink alcohol so I'm a big fan on there mock-tails really good. I also like the Suya prawns yummy. A bit overpriced but what do you expect at a place like that.  Nice water view",40,Dec-15,3.5,Churrasco
Mike G,good steak,"Went there for a couple of time. Food was always good especial the steaks.
Well the other food i didn't try yet but for sure it's not bad either.
will come back again.....",40,Feb-15,3.5,Churrasco
AdioB,Best Brazilian restaurant,"The restaurant has a tropical and bamboo theme. The salad buffet bar is shaped like a wooden canoe and is amazing because you have so many choices. Went there on New Years day. You have the option of meat, seafood or a combination of both...with your vegetables. Remember to use the red/green tile as the food can really pile up, because the food just keeps on coming.The cocktails and dessert were generously large and the view of the lagoon was just splendid. The restroom has a valet so you are in good hands. Pricey but Loved itMore",30,Jan-16,3.5,Churrasco
meadow m,"Expensive, but the concept is very good","My family and I have visited Churrasco about four times with friends, and the quality is always the same. 

The ambience is excellent and the staff are very friendly and nice.",40,Jul-15,3.5,Churrasco
GertdeBeer,Over priced imitation,Local attempt to copy the South American concept. Although it has a beautiful location the decor and service feel stale and the food not value for money. Menu is pricy and probably the reason for the few guests around...,35,Jun-15,3.5,Churrasco
Oyesola,Good restaurant but toooooo expensive,"So I went to Churrasco with my husband for dinner. A friend had told us about it, he said we would love the food and ambience and that it wasn't overly expensive. So with that in mind, off we went.

Churrasco is a grill restaurant...More",40,Apr-15,3.5,Churrasco
