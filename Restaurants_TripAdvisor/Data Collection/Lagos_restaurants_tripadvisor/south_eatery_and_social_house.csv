tafiyalove,Great Jambalaya and Mad People,"South Social is the perfect name, because it's all about the people. An amazing spot to visit on busy nights, it's like being part of a  hyper Lagos family. 

I still think about the Jambalaya a lot, and the cocktails pack quite a punch.

It's...a bit less exciting on quieter nights (like on Sundays), but it's nice to sit on the swing outside and just take in Lagos.More",45,Mar-20,4.5,South Eatery and Social House
gamboolman,Good steak,"For a steak out in Lagos on Victoria Isand, we enjoy the South. The atmosphere varies depending on the crowd but overall is a fun and very good evening out.",40,Aug-19,4.5,South Eatery and Social House

aadedayo,Not Bad,"Lovely ambiance. Great customer experience. Been craving the Jambalaya since I had been seeing the pictures everywhere and I thought I needed to have a taste. The meal was filling, couldn‚Äôt even finish mine. My already filled glass of water was dirty, I showed the...waiter and she immediately replaced the water and glass for me. I would definitely go there again.More",50,Sep-18,4.5,South Eatery and Social House
Subomi P,Too Austere For My Tastes,"I visited on a Sunday with my sisters.  The food was not bad and the environment looked organised. But the restaurant wasn't distinct and that's what I remember. I was expecting something with a bit more personality and I imagined the food would be tastier...and more memorable. 

I had the Jambalaya which was okay. I asked for it to made spicy and my request was granted. 

I liked the swing seating in the garden.

The price point is not cheap.More",40,Aug-18,4.5,South Eatery and Social House
Chichi N,Lovely place‚ù§Ô∏è,"Got a warm welcome immediately i walkd into the compound, think that was either the owner or manager. He was sitting outside with some friends, he left them and helped us settle in 1st before he went back and his staff continued. Beautiful place. The...staff were friendly and helped with my food and drink selection, which turned out well i must say. Jst that it was late, i dint get enough pictures üòÅ.

Mexgir,The French Burger,"After so many good comments about South; my husband and some friends decided to go for lunch on Saturday.  We all loved the ambiance, the staff was very friendly and the hamburgers were really good...I ordered The French one with camembert cheese and caramelized onions,...it was fantastic! We had a nice time. Definetely, highly recommended.More",50,Mar-18,4.5,South Eatery and Social House
Ashley648,Nice Addition to Lagos,"I enjoyed my experience at South. The atmosphere is very noisy and definitely better suited for energy filled outings but overall good. We were seated immediately and the wait staff attended to our table in a timely fashion. I had the chicken sandwich. It doesn‚Äôt...pack much flavor but I would attribute that to the mounds of slaw that tops it and the thickness of the bread verses the chicken itself. It was a bit overwhelming. The other downside is, the side item is extra slaw. It was a bit overkill for me. My total experience was decent compared to other places in Lagos so I plan to visit again in the future to try different items.More",50,Jan-18,4.5,South Eatery and Social House

Oyesola,Good for a group of friends,"So a friend chose this place for another friend's 30th birthday party. It was a group of almost 20. Because we were a lot, they gave us the set menu for #10,000 per person. 

That set menu was a rip off imo. The quantity was...just too small. It came with  a drink and a  bottle of  water. Tiny plates of 4 different starters for a table of 6/8. The bread and cheese spread was lovely so was the chicken balls. My friend tried the akara (bean cake) and said it was good. French fries and minced meat sauce was the fourth option for starter. The main meal did not go round. I was away and before I got back the rice had finished. I heard the quantity brought was so small it didn't go round and they refused to bring more. The macaroni and cheese for main went mostly untouched and the chicken was very dry. 

A set menu should not be a way of cheating customers. Customers should not leave your restaurant feeling they did not get value for money which was the case here.

The food was ok but I won't be returning here anytime soon. Went home hungry.More",40,Jan-18,4.5,South Eatery and Social House
