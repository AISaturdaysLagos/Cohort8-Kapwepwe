Christopher S,"Good food still, but where's the band?","Pat's seems to have gone a bit downhill recently - the Sunday evening band and BBQ used to be excellent but aren't happening any more. I hope they start that up again.

It's not a place you'd take the family. But that applies to most...bars I've been to in West Africa. The service is good, the food has never made me or any of my colleagues ill and the pizzas are really not bad at all. The outside area is pleasant enough, but inside can be a bit noisy. Crucially, the drinks are cold, although you tend to have to emphasise the point if you want a really cold beer.

The friendly female clientele aren't too annoying. If you want a quiet evening on your own to have a drink and something to eat, the best strategy is to buy whoever sits next to you a drink, make it clear that you're not interested and then let her sit there and keep the others away. 

When leaving it's best to make sure your Uber or driver are waiting right outside before you walk out. That way you can avoid the hawkers and the attentions of the ladies who haven't been allowed in or have been chucked out.More",35,Jan-20,3.5,Pats Bar
