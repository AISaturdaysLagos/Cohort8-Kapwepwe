Ravi D,Bar Campione,"This place started quite well and the food is quite good.
In the recent past, its concentration has been on being a watering hole.
Food quality has dropped and service too.",45,Jul-14,4,Bar Campione

n1spm,Very good,"We enjoyed a very good dinner with the family at Bar Campione. For a sports bar, the quality and variety of food will exceed most peoples expectations. Good value too.",40,,4,Bar Campione
AbhijeetNayak,Nice Place to hangout at night,"A bar cum lounge with bar seating. Originally a sports bar, it also plays party music on some nights. Have been here twice, once the crowd was decent, another time the place was empty. The chef is Indian & offers few Indian dishes.",30,Dec-13,4,Bar Campione
M R,"Good value sports bar, clean and friendly","Reasonable prices and a nice ambience - although I would imagine it gets a little hectic / noisy during big matches.  I only sampled the Garlic Bread with a couple of Heinekens but it was fine and not too expensive.  The menu looked decent so...will be trying something more substantial next time. Worth a visit, especially if you are a sports fan.More",30,Mar-14,4,Bar Campione
ZeeGoes,Good food + snail paced service,"My friends and I enjoy trying out new restaurants, and when Bar Campione opened, we went for it. Good prices, tasty pasta dishes, customer service needs work and the food came out over1hr after we ordered...i've been to italian restaurants where the pasta was hand...made right before firing up each dish, even those did not take 1hr to arrive. We were the only ones here, just 3 gals and about 5 waiters that kept disappearing. I think there was a game on that day...nevertheless, that was bad on their end. We also ordered some starters that arrived an hour later with our main course. 

Also went there for a friend's birthday, good finger food also.More",50,Nov-13,4,Bar Campione
Bharathi-Wong,No.2 is too high appraisal for it,"we went there one month ago. It was a few people there during lunch time. The service was not very caring and the food was so so, but the price was not so so, high. the atmosphere is still ok. Probably the evening service will...be better. Anyway I do not want to try it during lunch time.More",20,Nov-13,4,Bar Campione
CSRam,Bar Campione,I was invited by a friend and I did not know such a place existed even though I lived close by. I liked its food and the ambience.Not very expensive too.,40,Oct-13,4,Bar Campione
Pinkjacket,Excellent time out,"Hung out with a bestie at this place and it was based purely on reviews. We wanted to eat at a restaurant which none of us has been before. More like war dinning :-). Campione came well reviewed on the web.

Our first impression wasn't...too good. The paint at the bottom of the walls were bubbly or peeling of and the men's had a terrible smell - clean but odorous. 

The time for food. Quick service. Impressive attention and excellent recommendation on what's OK. Henry, who waited on us, was so good. He even cross-sold a Friday event to my friend. It was customer service at its best.

Will I go there again? Absolutely! However a new coat of pain would do everyone a lot of good.More",40,Oct-13,4,Bar Campione
John D,Perfect Sports Bar and Restaurant,"I have been to Bar Campione quite a few times. The food is good, service is great. It can get quite busy, especially on weekends and Champions league nights because of the football games.On one occasion I had to wait outside until there was space...available.
Whenever I'm in town, I drive down to Bar Campione to see interesting football games, the atmosphere there is so perfect for that. I get to watch these games on a 200 inch screen plus they've got the best pizzas in town.More",30,Jul-13,4,Bar Campione

Emily M,Best Italian Restaurant in Africa,"I visited Bar Campione thrice during my last trip to Lagos and it exceeded all expectations. Extremely impressed by quality of food, authenticity, detail to presentation and impeccable service by the staff made me want to go back for a meal each weekend I was...there. I have spent many years in the Province of Lombardia, Italy, and can honestly say that the meals I had at Bar Campione cannot be distinguished from what one would be served in a high end Italian restaurant in Italy itself. If you like Italian food then this is one of the best restaurants you can go to! I cannot say enough about this restaurant, it is one of a kind and definitely worth the visit. The modern decor, friendly staff, wonderful ambience and above all the outstanding food makes me give it a 10+ on a rating of 1-10.More",30,Jun-13,4,Bar Campione
diksha3001,Awesome food and ambiance!!!,"This is one place I love to dine. The food is simply awesome and they are so consistent with the quality of food. A must go place when you have football match going on, as they have a big screen on the first floor.",40,May-13,4,Bar Campione
FoodieMommie,An interesting mix of good and mediocre,"I went to BC because of the great reviews here but tried to manage my expectations as there are only a couple of restaurants in Lagos I would describe as being all rounders (atmosphere, great food, yummy desserts and reasonable prices).

Jonathan N,Best Restaurant in Lagos by a long way,"I found out about Bar Campione through Trip Advisor, so it is only appropriate that I spread the word, and help others find this gem of a place.

AnalogueJedi,"Small portions, Expensive","Dishes are average,  Very stingy with their portions...  Especially when you see the price in the end.  If you are not there to watch any sports games, avoid it because it will get very loud when they are on.",50,Jul-12,4,Bar Campione
pizzaloverboy,High on the list in Lagos,"Visited BC with friends based on TripAdvisor reviews and we were not disappointed.

Duncan S,New sports bar,"New bar venue with lots of TV screens for the sports enthusiast. Went to watch a football game during Euro 2012. Had pizzas at the bar - disappointing and dry base.
