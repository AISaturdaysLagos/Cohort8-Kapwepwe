joycebJ816WG,No atmosphere,As a book club Christmas meeting I thought this would be somewhere cool and different. It was not. The manager was not very pleasant and there was absolutely no atmosphere.

Colleend55,Pleasantly Delightful,"I usually don’t write reviews but I felt compelled to give a shout out to Velvett. I organised son’s 19th B day party at this venue.
VENUE: Velvett is a Restaurant / lounge - Amazing Ambience, really lit Vibe. Well maintained decor and furniture.  Bonus...is that the place can turn into your own personal night club as has a large Dj booth  (you can bring your own DJ) tucked away in one corner, walled in Glass, so does not affect the flow and vibe of the restaurant. 
CONTACT: The Manager Mr. Johnson was just great - very personable, approachable, knew his job as Manager and you could tell, he is from
the school of thought of “the customer is always right”, when dealing with patrons unlike a large number of his counterparts found in Lagos restaurants. I also had brief contact with a Mario - “the Oga below the oga at the top”. Though our contact was brief, he had an air of being accommodating in his manner. 
Mr Johnson and I, talked through order of service for the party, food menu and beverage options both alcoholic and non alcoholic. He was very insightful on quantities and the restaurant was honest in its final bill to us. 
FOOD: Their menu is really very good it’s not a fine dining restaurant but still very good with an eclectic mix of meat, and seafood dishes, also imbued with a good variety of Lebanese dish options including the availability of shisha.  I would describe their menu genre as “elevated” comfort food - food that makes you feel not good but REALLY good. The birthday party food was a good selection of meats and poultry, salads and seafood - in a generous quantity - no skimping there - I am told by guests there was a lot of food but non went to waste.  

Would definitely use venue again and even eat there for “elevated” comfort food.  I hope they maintain their current plateau but of course any improvement like say corkage on alcohol for weekday events would be a corker!More",10,Apr-18,4.5,Vellvett Grill Lounge and Bar
