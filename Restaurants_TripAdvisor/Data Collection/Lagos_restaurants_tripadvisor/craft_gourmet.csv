Marzia A,Love It!,"Craft Gourmet is always worth the visit, never disappointing. Located on the third floor of Mega Plaza (Victoria Island, Lagos), everything about the place leaves little to nothing to complain about. 

The food is good and well worth the price, the menu offers a good...variety of food, drinks and dessert, the ambience is serene and peaceful and the setup as a whole is upscale. Arrival time of the food was short and the waiters are usually pleasant. The restaurant has also taken steps to be covid compliant e.g. with the introduction of e-menus as opposed to physical versions. 

The cocktail menu is a tad bit limited but that's honestly a small issue, hence the 5 star rating.More",45,Aug-19,4.5,Craft Gourmet
