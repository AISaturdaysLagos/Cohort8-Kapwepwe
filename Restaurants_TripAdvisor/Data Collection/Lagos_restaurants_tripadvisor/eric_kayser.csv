Kehinde O,Picking up snacks,"Usually go to Eric Kayser for their desserts. The Croissants are a bit too oily for me (I like them dry and crispy) and the girls need to brighten up. l always feel like they are forced to do their jobs. My best dessert is...the Opera.
Everything else is pretty average.More",40,Sep-23,4,Eric Kayser

Merlin1920,What a happy discovery.. a touch of Europe in the heart of Lagos,On a business trip to Lagos we were told to meet at Eric Kayser.. no idea that it was a café/restaurant so when we turned up it was a pleasant surprise to find a a very upmarket meeting place. Coffee great as are the bakeries...and very friendly and efficient service. So in the end we spent most of two days in either the VI or Ikoyi locations meeting people who were all happy to meet there..  Personally I prefer Ikoyi as its more like a club setting.. I'll be back..More,40,Jan-23,4,Eric Kayser
A A,"Mediocre food, low value for money","The place is well located, simple but yet effective design.
The food was mediocre, steak over cooked, greens with almost no taste and a gratin ridiculously fat.
We thought that the desserts will save the situation however the brownie was just a huge pile of...ice cream with tiny bits of a very toffee like brownie, very far from what a brownie should look and taste like.
Prices, expensive as usual at this place, value for money, not much.More",35,Aug-22,4,Eric Kayser
jujustinang,"Poor quality, not fresh and Teeth marks on the served vegetables !!","We ordered from the restaurant via OyaNow. English Breakfast and halloumi breakfast.
The English breakfast was ok but the halloumi breakfast was way below expectations. The bread was unevenly cut: one slice was completely dry on one side, another slice was so thin it couldn’t...hold anything put on it but that’s not the reason for my review.
What I was completely appalled by was the quality of vegetables added to the dish. If you decide to accompany bread and cheese with 3 slices of tomato or cucumber maybe some damn effort about what you are serving. Half of tomato served was tomato but and the most disgusting thing was cucumber apart from the fact that it was dry and definitely not freshly cut - it ALSO HAD SOMEONE’S TEETH MARKS on it! I obviously threw it away and lost my appetite. Pictures attached. Needless to say - I will never order from them again.More",30,Jul-22,4,Eric Kayser

irishboy4,The good and bad of breakfast #1stworldproblems,"First the positives. The scrambled egg with salmon looked good, the salmon was salty however. The coffee was very strong, which is also good. The waitress called Patience was delightful and despite being very busy she was as attentive as she could be. Negatives we...were seated by the kitchen hatch and it was noisy, one of the managers was very close to us and did not greet or say hello during the duration of our visit. Lastly a #1stworld comment or description of my Croissant, which was tiny in size and tasted like white bread with a rubber band in the middle, it fell off my plate and bounced back up to the table, that was a joke but it was an insult to French cuisine to label it a croissant. I recall eating them for breakfast in Paris, dipping the fluffy pastry in my coffee and when your teeth bit through the crackly outside to the fluttery, tissue-thin layers beneath, you tasted butter with that hint of creamy sweetness that really good butter brings. The Eric Kaiser version was an example that bore no comparison and should have been left in the kitchen waste with off cuts of food and egg shells.More",30,Jan-22,4,Eric Kayser

bosedeo2017,A Sweet experience,"Went for a celebratory lunch with my family. Right from the free valet parking to the pleasant hostess that led us to our table to the waitress who waited on us to the food….amazing! You are treated as if you are the only one they...are waiting for…., even though the place was packed!! My family just found our new favorite place in Lagos ❤️More",50,Jul-21,4,Eric Kayser
Trav26097919,Pre boiled pasta —- over priced and under delivers,Ikoyi branch- I have held off on this review a few times. As this place is local to me. But on each occasion they deliver very very sub par food. Just received a Bolognese and the pasta was disgraceful. They pre boil the pasta …....Set it aside and reheat… really. It’s terrible and very very poor for the price and the market they claim to serve. There is little to be impressed with here. Many of the items are prepped at another branch with no cold chain controls. So beware. You’ll be charged a lot for very low quality execution. Management are consistently sitting at the table nearest the door. And don’t like feedback.More,40,Jul-21,4,Eric Kayser
Ade703,"Nice place, good food, great ambience","Eric Kayser is a great place particularly to get pastries/pastry-based food, not that they don't have other food options available though. Lovely ambience, central location, modern decor and good quality food. It's a good spot for both intimate dining or group hangouts. The price point...is as expected - neither cheap nor overly expensive. The waiters are attentive and food preparation time wasn't bad at all. 

Avoid going too close to their current closing time of 10pm though as the pressure for them to close becomes tangible and you get the sense of being rushed.More",30,May-21,4,Eric Kayser
NaijaBabe2016,French Cuisine and so much more at it's finest! 🗼🥗🍕🍳🥓🥘🥩🥪🍔🍛🌭🍝🍩🍰🍮🥧🍨🍪🍦🍫🍧🥃☕🍹👍🏽😋,"I had never heard of Eric Kayser Artisan Boulanger until my husband drove me directly to the restaurant on a not-too-busy Victoria Island Road. I immediately had a good feeling when I spotted this fancy Parisian eatery. The place oozed style and grace, from the...outside to the inside. The restaurant was cool, airy, bright, spotless and had a 'kick back & relax' vibe to it. The decor was contemporary, simple and tasteful. Eric Kayser Artisan Boulanger had a sizeable menu! They have everything from Breakfast, (with a big focus on eggs), Salads, Club Sandwiches, as well as Hot and Cold Sandwiches, Les Quiche Maison, Burgers, Pastas, Le Pizzeria (Du Boulanger), 'Proper' Dishes like Filet Mignon, Filet de Poisson, Chicken Milanese and Filet de Saumon. Other offerings include a dedicated Kids Meals, Frappes & Frozen Drinks, Hot Drinks, Fresh Drinks, Mocktails and a vast array of phenomenal desserts! 

I ordered the KAYSER QUICHE (goat cheese & chicken). This was accompanied by a robust side salad. We also got the CHICKEN PANINI (roast chicken breast, french mustard, tomato & mozarella); both my hubby and I. He got the LABNEH PLATE (labneh, zaatar, cucumbers, tomatoes & olives). For drinks, I got the VIRGIN PINA COLADA. LOTUS CHEESECAKE and CREME BRULEE was our dessert. I must say that everything tasted out of this world delicious! 😋 The food 'reeked' of freshness and quality; pure perfection! 👍🏽 Service was awesome. Every staff member was courteous, diligent and professional. What really blew me away about Eric Kayser Boulanger was the absolutely insane amount of desserts and pastries that were available for purchase over the counter. It was as if I had been transported to the streets of Paris and had wondered into one of their very many wonderful cafes or boulangeries! 🗼😁 Is it any wonder why this phenomenal restaurant can be found in over 20 countries, on 6 different continents? 

It is worth mentioning that Eric Kayser Artisan Boulanger sells so many incredible desserts, which are beautifully displayed in multiple show glasses. These include Muffins, Brownies, Macaroons, Chouquettes, Strawberry/Nutella Beignet (Doughnuts), Mini Viennoise, Creme Brulee (regular & chocolate), Meringues, Chocolate/Vanilla/Coffee/Nutella Eclairs and Apricot Sable. 'Dreamy' Cakes include Opera, 'Le Kayser', Delice Coco, Three Chocolate, Millenium, Crousty and Moka. There's also a fantastic selection of tarts like Lemon, Coconut, Strawberry, Almond, and so much more. Cheesecake flavors include Blueberry, Lotus and Mixed Berry. 

The 'plethora' of assorted breads and savory bakes & pastries is simply to die for! 🍞🥨🥖🥐 Seriously, you will be spoiled for choice here! These include, but are not limited to all kinds of Baguettes, Granola Bread, Brown Bread, Sourdough Bread, Raisin/Nut Bread, Campagne, Almond/Zaatar/Nutella Croissants, Flute Cheese, Langue de Chat and Brioche Tresse. Vegetarian 'Kayser', Salmon Quiche and the very famous Quiche Lorraine are available for purchase directly from the show glass. I must also give an 'honorable mention' to the Gelato that is sold at Eric Kayser. Flavors I saw were Raspberry, White Chocolate, Bounty, Mango, Amarena, Strawberry, After 8, Malaga, Cheesecake, Bailey's, Pineapple, 'Shtroump' (blue, Smurf's-inspired ice cream), 3 Chocolate, Banana and Unicorn (for kiddies). 

So in conclusion, I had a most impressive experience at Eric Kayser Artisan Boulanger, because not a single thing was amiss in this terrific restaurant. It was so refreshing to not know what to expect because I had never heard of this apparently very well known Parisian chain, and I'm thrilled to say that it did not disappoint whatsoever! I now have a new food joint to 'hit' whenever I visit my favorite city in Nigeria, therefore I eagerly anticipate returning to Eric Kayser, if not for anything, but for the superb spread of the most amazing looking pastries, ice cream, baked goods and treats that I have no doubt in my mind will be mind-blowing, sinfully delicious! Fantastic French Eatery in the heart of Victoria Island that will be worth your while to visit. Trust me, you will not regret coming to Eric Kayser Artisan Boulanger! Highly, highly, highly recommended!!! 👍🏽😋👍🏽😋More",40,Apr-21,4,Eric Kayser
RitzAroundTheWorld,A breath of 'French' air 😍!,"Okay...so I've never been to France...therefore the thought of a Parisian restaurant in Victoria Island, Lagos excited me a bit. Let's just say I was impressed by the speed of getting my plate done and served, especially as it seemed like a very busy Sunday...evening - what with the footfall in the restaurant. 

Anyway...I went with my BFF and the staff were really nice - from the (free) valet parking staff to the COVID-19 regulation compliant staff; all the way from the door to the waiters and counter attendants. They were really courteous throughout (observing COVID-19 protocol from beginning to the end of our stay at the restaurant, such that we felt really comfortable eating there without fear of getting droplets in our food). They showed that they truly cared.

My friend and I ordered our meals and actually timed the waiters - meals took less than 20 minutes (drinks came earlier). We were quite impressed.

The staff were on their toes making sure everything went well. At some point my friend complained to another waiter about not getting the right sting in the hot sauce that came with her meal...not realising that the original waiter who attended to us was observing. This original  waiter quickly came to us, liaised with the other waiter and brought the spicy sauce. I just thought that is a bit rare these days.

It's also a modern restaurant where you get to scan the menu QR code to place your order. Good luck to you if you're still living in the past 😄.

All in all, the variety was decent. My meal tasted great for the price I paid (no regrets). We had a good time there.More",50,Mar-21,4,Eric Kayser
Seth B,Great for breakfast/coffee,"Atmosphere - best breakfast meeting place on Victoria Island. Open and sunlit. It's the place for people to connect. We had multiple meetings there.

Nisfornimi,Eric kayser restaurant  rating,We were chasing the waiters before they answered us. The caponari spag or whatever it’s called was terrible. The strawberry milkshake was awful.
