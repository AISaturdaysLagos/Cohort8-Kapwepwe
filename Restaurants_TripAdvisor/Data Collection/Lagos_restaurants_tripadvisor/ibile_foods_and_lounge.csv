ilahosas,"No menu with price tag , waiters just inflate prices","The food is managable,  customer service is very poor due to tribalism n mismanagement which will eventually fold up the business. 
There is no menu with price tag , just order n wait for the waiter to inflate the price with a straight face.
A...portion of rice is 800 n its 2 serving spoon which is not upto half of the take out pack

A portion of plantain is 300 with 20-25 diced pieces 

The salad is nice 500 I no too vex

Wetin vex me na the kekere ponmo wey dem call jumbo ponmo which is 400

I ended up spending 2000 for rice,plantain, pomo n salad wey no belleful me

Food I bought is equivalent to 2packs of indomie

I for just drink tea n bread with egg sleep

Am so pained, this is extortion.

TitiDokubo,Affordable meals,"The ambience at Ibile is quite welcoming. It's a restaurant that caters to local dishes with the provision of a lounge upstairs. The lounge can be used for meetings, small gatherings etc.

The meal served here is decently priced at an average rate of 600...Naira. I would say their soups are quite delicious and made just like the locals of that soup would have made it. Honestly, their sausage happens to be the best I've had in along while. 

You truly get a taste of home at Ibile.More",10,May-18,3.5,Ibile Foods and Lounge
