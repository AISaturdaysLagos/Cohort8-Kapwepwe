Busayo O,Overpriced cafeteria.,"The concept of this restaurant is brilliant. However, the execution is bad. The cuisine was confusing, and the food doesn't average tasting, nothing memorable.  The ambience, which is supposed to be the selling point, was disrupted with some load music from a big bad speaker...hanging from the wall.  Toilet has no way to lock so someone can open the door on you while you're doing your business. The waiters are trying too hard but need some training. 
I had high hopes for this restaurant and wanted it to be perfect and I was ready to pay the premium price for it but I should have gone  to cafeteria next door at least they won't pretend to be premium and they'd serve better meals.More",20,Apr-23,2,Kapadoccia
