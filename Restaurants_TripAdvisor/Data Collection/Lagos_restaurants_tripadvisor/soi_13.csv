AbimbolaNN,Good Thai foor and relaxing ambience,Enjoyed dinner here with a friend. I speak more for the atmosphere at the roof top space than the food which wasn't bad overall. Our order was mixed up and we were served a modified variant of the appetizer but the Manager made sure our...initially ordered items were brought at no extra cost even though we had eaten the first set. Portion sizes are reasonable and the pricing is moderate.More,50,Nov-18,5,Soi 13
_Craig_889,Very relaxing & great Thai soups & fried rice,"Had a really nice meal here after work. Food is very authentic, reasonably priced for VI and presented well and it was lovely and relaxing to sit outside,  above the hustle and bustle of rush hour as the sun was setting in a clear sky...- rare for VI. Will definitely be going again and trying other things on the menu.More",40,Oct-18,5,Soi 13
