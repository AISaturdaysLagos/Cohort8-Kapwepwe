JusticeJoyce,Ambience & Vibe = Adult but some Entrees are Lacking,"Great service. 
Food just average. 
I'd recommend Fresh Cut fries anytime. 
Beef Bourguignon - beef wasn't sliced as thick as I anticipated but not suya street meat thin. It's served separate from the mashed potatoes. Included zucchini, carrot and just a touch of onions. The...sauce could have been more robust with flavor. Even the French cook with my more spices/seasoning/flavor. 

Lobster Thermidor - forever grateful they do not use egg. The rice pilaf that's served alongside is as bland and flavorless as possible. You'll do best rolling the thermidor amongst the rice so the cream rolls into the rice. A half portion was sufficient, but I'd totally recommend the full serving should you have time/money/room. 

Chicken Sandwich (Burger) - this was chosen as grilled over battered. We had a lot of carbs so there's that. The fries were crisp and seasoned as they should be but you rarely find in these parts. Topped with lettuce. Mayo spread. Tomato slices. Fried onions that were cold against everything else. Recommend with a notice to watch for the toppings condiments if you have allergens.

Truffle Pasta with homemade fettuccine - I was asked and opted for the homemade pasta. I probably should have went with the store bought. The Parmesan cheese topping is authentic but the truffles were hard to find and Taste yet the butter was prominently evident. Given all the dishes and the lack of flavor begging for immediate consumption - I had it packed to go home via takeaway. 

By the way they charge for ToGo containers. Take away. At these prices it should be included. 

Service was attentive. 
Saturday night had 4 tables total and the service didn't fail. 
The welcoming bread basket was served via a paper napkin in the bowl. Given these prices and location - I'd expect a cloth napkin at best. They have monogrammed cloth napkins at different seats in the restaurant. 
Vibe - good for a date night or group or family. Took the window view and sat in the booth. Lighting was apropos for the mood.  

I shall return for salads, soup and fried shrimp. Plus, I know I'd like to try 1 dessert eventually but no rush to drop 40-60k. 
See the pictures for the dishes.More",40,Feb-22,4,Noir
Ayo O,Fine Dinning in Fine Portions,"Noir boasts of fair parking space- that is important when you choose to dine out on a weekend evening in Lagos.

 Climb up to the restaurant on the first floor and the interior welcomes you with brilliant Nigerian paintings that adorn its walls and a...full length window that gives a view of the street outside. House Music remixes of popular contemporary songs played in the background . Each table has a hand sanitizer for guests and the restroom is neat.

The waiters are attentive and their adaptability quite commendable.
However, the food..., yes, the food. 
For a glass of tropical cocktail juice at Noir, I expect hand-squeezed fresh fruits and not the obvious mix of supermarket packed juices.

The seafood salad arrives and looks colourful but the chef is miserly with the shrimps. I can make out the three pieces tucked beneath the lush greenery.
I compare this same meal I had ordered at another restaurant within the neighbourhood and certainly the chef here is quite restrained in his/her portions.

A good experience but I drive away wondering if I was billed, more for the ambience, than the meal.More",30,Sep-21,4,Noir

JoanO539,Expensive Business Outing,"Many thanks for your review, we look forward serving you again!",40,Jun-19,4,Noir
BOSSLADY205,Doesn't get any better than NOIR!,"We went out in a party of 20 for a business dinner, and sent in our orders the prior evening in order to speed up things we thought.
The starters were delicious and the ambience outside was great, even if there was some mix-up with...some of the drinks( Virgin Colada not being so virgin!)
The meal in itself was average and nothing  fantastic compared to the cost, and the waiters  could do with a bit of training as fare as fine dinning goes. Altogether a decent evening, but not value for money in my view.More",40,Apr-19,4,Noir
_abisheart,great food and attentive staff,By far the overall experience at this restaurant was amazing. The waiters were spectacular. The owner was awesome. The food and drinks were AMAZING! Thank God for this gem we found in Lagos!,50,Mar-19,4,Noir
Dupri00,Expensive,"went as a group of friends. The food was really good and the steak was excellent. The staff were also friendly and attentive .
very good coffee as well üëçüèΩ",40,Sep-18,4,Noir
oyinlolao2018,Lovely dinner,"Nice ambience but very expensive.

Waiters are well versed in the meals served and are quite competent for what you will get for a similar restaurant in Lagos.

Food is average in my view. Typically, contemporary food is served and great wines are available as...well.

Nice place to go for fine dining but watch your pocket.More",40,Jan-19,4,Noir
lizzielicious,Attentive manager,"Had dinner with a friend. The waiter was exceptional. The food was tasty, we had fried calamari as a starter then ordered different meals.  

My friend had jumbo prawns and pasta. I has Seafood Gratin, it was cheesy and tasty. I also had vegetables as...a side. It‚Äôs pricier than other places but worth a try if you want to experiment with French food. 

For drinks we did smoothies which were really good. We were too stuffed to have desert. 

I love the ambience and service.More",50,Nov-18,4,Noir
ooobabatunde,Flat,"My partner and I visited here as part of the Visa Restaurant Week. On first appearances and impression, we thought it was going to be an unpleasant experience. When we were sat down, the group of guests on the next table were having a heated...argument with the waiter. Apparently the prices on the menu didn‚Äôt match what they were charged on their receipts and I and my partner could hear everything going on. Secondly, the Visa menu didn‚Äôt state that the mains come without sides so we had to order sides with our mains at extra cost. Thirdly, we were given very hard butter with our bread basket and we had to send the butter back twice just so we could be given spreadable butter. The wine selection was good though and we really enjoyed the red wine we had with our meal. During our meal, the restaurant manager came up to ask for feedback and we mentioned the hard butter and the sides not coming with our mains and as a goodwill gesture, she made our sides complimentary. Although it wasn‚Äôt a perfect experience, it generally a nice one and it helped that the manager was very receptive to our feedback. I‚Äôd visit again.More",40,Dec-18,4,Noir
Aarinola,Great band! Lovely ambiance,"Came with my wife, not impressed with the location, unless it's owned by the Supermarket not my kind of scene.
They didn't have the wine I wanted ( this actually is typical) I did ask the waiter if they had all the wines on the...wine list! I asked to see 2 French wines and he brought 1 Spanish and French!!! 

The bread they brought was a let down. We were actually shocked at the quality + we asked for warm bread, it came cold! They warmed it when we returned it. 

We enjoyed our starters, my foie gras was nice enough and my wife enjoyed salmon. Although presentation can be improved upon. 

We had steak cooked at our table, nice experience however I expected a little bit more flair... we enjoyed the meat.
The dessert was nice and we had no complaints.  

We both agreed customer service has serious room for improvement,  no greetings (from supervisory staff and several waiters) the waiter who brought our cold bread looked like he was being forced to do the task, dropped the bread without a single greeting,  spilled oil on the table, didn't acknowledge or apologize and just walked away. 

I gave some feedback to Festus (one of the waiters who looked like a supervisor) about equipping waiters with adequate information before sending them off to interface with guests. 

It is not a cheap place and as such I expected a little bit more in terms of service.  This was our first time and we agreed we would most likely not return. 

And before I forget, music was too loud, (guess I'm too OLD!)More",30,May-18,4,Noir
Mexgir,Nice restaurant but soupy salad,"The ambience is simply fantastic. You‚Äôd have to make a reservation first before coming. On arrival I was taking to our table, our waiter seemed to have too much on his mind or he probably was having one of those off days so he kept...mixing up our orders or didn‚Äôt place the order in the kitchen at all but other than that, the other waiters were professional and tried to salvage the situation. Cocktails were pretty and descent and so was our meal. If it‚Äôs a full night parking your car might be an issue is one downside. The band was so so fantastic, they played good music through the evening, I literally had goosebumps.we went on a Friday night, music wasn‚Äôt loud so you could still hear yourself talk. Be warned Noir isn‚Äôt cheap so go with your pocket full! All in all it was a great night at Noir.More",30,Jun-18,4,Noir
iyoboi,Didn‚Äôt live up to expectations,"I was there the first time for dinner with my husband and a friend and the service and food were very good. 

The second time was for lunch, ordered a prawn salad and it came with only 3 prawns, the arugula was all covered with...such an intense ginger dressing that it was imposible to eat. If you want to order this salad, suggest to ask for the dressing separately. 

Cocktails are great.More",30,May-18,4,Noir
