Sam G,Used to be great place,Used to be my favorite hangout here in Lagos. Unfortunately not many normal customers these days yet too many very annoying hookers present.,40,Oct-22,4,The Long Bar Lagos
Etan O,Sunday evening relaxation,"I've known the proprietor here, Dave Jeeves for quite some time, we have fished together. Decided to have a fillet steak with fries this evening and it was a pleasant surprise. Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised! Tender, juicy, flavourful and a real pleasure sitting...at the newly appointed outside bar. Ambiance was great, fans whirring above my head, ice cold Heineken, chasing a Jack. All round pleasant evening.More",40,Aug-19,4,The Long Bar Lagos

gcxotf,Bar with a twist,While in Lagos Long Bar is a great place to kick back and have a drink and bite to eat. The food is pretty good and service it some of the best in Lagos. On the weekends the entertainment is kicked up a notch to...say the least. Do yourself a favor and head to Long Bar if your are in need of a good drinking hole.More,50,Mar-18,4,The Long Bar Lagos
Kevin S,lagos,"The long bar has some kind of place behind the actual building under thatch roof which can easily sit around 30 people.The waiters there are very good ,give personalized service. the ambiance very good,  Been to this place 3 to 4 times.The starters are very...good.The chips are very well made. Have had variety of dishes here, recently had Singapore noodles it tasted good and was reasonable portion size.We ordered fried rice, we got rice with too much turmeric in it and the potion was very small. and sometimes I see proper main bill being presented and sometimes I get to see only the receipts which they put in the plastic cup given to us and it is totaled and we are told to pay. I think the management has to look into these things.More",50,Mar-17,4,The Long Bar Lagos
robertgB5456BA,"English pub in Lagos, as much or as little as you want","Went with some colleagues ona Saturday night, a little bit of an upmarket Pat's or Troy
Good company available and decent choice of drinks. Beer cold. What else can you ask for?",40,May-17,4,The Long Bar Lagos
Hardegun,Best Lamb Shank in Lagos!!!,"visited here about 3 times per week when I was working there, friendly staff cold beer and very good food",40,Mar-17,4,The Long Bar Lagos
abhayd2015,"its a Mans world at Long bar, great Indian food and cheap booze.","Been going to Long Bar on regular and frequent basis for a while now. It is as close as anything i could call my local.
Dave the owner is a friendly guy, helpful and owns a fishing boat, hence the occasional specials of tuna, dorado...etc on the menu. The food is all prepared on site and is very reasonably priced. The good old fashioned favourite of chicken tikka is really very good and naan bread is almost a mal in itself. Drinks are varied and again reasonably priced.
Out back has been changed and is now enclosed, offering some privacy if required and can cater for functions, staff parties etc or an entertaining night out with a few of your mates. The staff are friendly and welcoming. Can get crowded late at the weekends but is not usually an issue and only serves to feed the generally great atmosphere. Passing through then definitely give it a go. If you live in Lagos then notch it up as your local.More",30,Dec-16,4,The Long Bar Lagos
douglasvh,Great Fish Specials,"English styled pub with  friendly staff, the manager is a wonderful guy, always willing to help. Over the years  and till date, my friends and I have become so fond of Long Bar. Drinks are very reasonable priced and food is above average. God place...to catch up on Rugby games as well.More",40,Nov-16,4,The Long Bar Lagos
Samjcb,Great Expat Bar with decent food,"Any bar where a 12 years Glenfiddich is priced same as a Chivas, a Red Label and a Smirnoff rocks in my book.
Great place to unwind if you are a single expat, and the best chicken tikkas coupled with absolutely awesome Nan's. its does...get a bit boisterous and like any Lagos bar has a lot of strangers who seem to want to sleep in your bed rather than their own, but as long as you can stay away from them the place is a what a boy would look for in a bar.More",40,Jul-16,4,The Long Bar Lagos
Mark R,Looking for fun? You will find it here,We usually go here aver week or two to get fish and tandoori chicken. They serve fish specials like barracuda and fresh tuna that the owner catches himself. There is a bar in the front with a more subdued dining area in the back. Not...a family friendly place though. It gets a bit rowdy in the bar at night.More,40,Sep-16,4,The Long Bar Lagos

Stewart456,Where the customer comes first,"The boys took me here on a Friday night. Drinks were good and the entertainment was fun. It was a blast. I would suggest that if you are in town you owe it to yourself to check out Long bar on Friday night. It was...packed when we were there  but the atmosphere was great. I was told that the Fish and Chips are the best in town, I should be having them tomorrow night. LOL.More",40,May-16,4,The Long Bar Lagos

Henrique G,Good food with relaxed atmosphere.,"Wow!  What a lot of change can do.  This use to be called Cheers.  Ha, it was nothing close to what you're thinking.  Although, the bar was filled with Norms and Cliffs.  The menu is great and at reasonable prices.",40,Jan-16,4,The Long Bar Lagos
vicquic,A fairly low standard place,"Good for a late night drink, alongside street walkers and ageing expats. I would not bother to ever go unless in good company and simply seeking to prolong the night not in a hotel bar.",45,Nov-15,4,The Long Bar Lagos
LagosDave,Saturday Fish and Chips,Being based in Lagos I often look for typical British comfort food and Fish and Chips at Long Bar usually hits the point!,50,Oct-15,4,The Long Bar Lagos
Pieter_Mari,My local in Lagos,"I am a fairly regular at the Long Bar (23A Tony Anegbode Street, Victoria island, Lagos) for their well priced beer, sports channels and pub grub.
