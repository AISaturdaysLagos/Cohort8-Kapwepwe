Peter B,Great place to relax either inside or in the outside garden area.,"I visit this place often for a beer after work or meals. Service is always very good. Great Menu, great food ... always welcomed back as an old friend. Very quiet place not part of the maddening crowd so very seldom filled to capacity ....Music remains in the background which for Nigeria is a welcome escape.More",40,Oct-19,4,Utopia
Y6571FYandyc,Nice place. Good service but overpriced for what it is,"I went on a Saturday night at around 10 pm. I expected it to be heaving with people but I think my friend and I were the only two people there (in fairness it was an election Saturday which have materially affected the number of...customers). There was no music playing when we entered but having sat down the music started. I asked if they could turn it off and was told that they couldn't (as the only people there, their refusal begs question about their customer responsiveness),

The menu is varied and covers burgers, chicken, steaks and a bunch of other foods. I selected the Sticky Chilli Beef with Jollof Rice, my friend opted for the Utopia Burgert and fries. Given that the restaurant was not busy there was a long wait for the food to arrive.

When it did arrive the Chilli beef was ok but not spectacular. It was not particularly spicy but was sticky and was beef!! The portion size was ok. The Jollof rice was bland. My friend enjoyed his Utopia burger which included ham and egg.

The price for a burger is more than you would pay at Johnny Rockets and not as good. The chilli beef is more than you would pay st s medium priced Chinese restaurant and not as good.

There's nothing significantly bad about this place. Maybe going at a busier time would have made the atmosphere more conducive to a positive customer experience. As it was, everything was ok apart from the waitress who was very good. It just wasn't a good value for money experience.More",40,Mar-19,4,Utopia
G5961YWdavida,Very Nice Food,Food was well made and waiters were very responsive and helpful. Enjoyed my time there. Will recommend for anyone looking for well made chicken in cheese sauce.,40,Jan-19,4,Utopia
Oyeols,Good taste and sizeable portions,"The Good:
Decor and aesthetic of the place was pretty good. 

The portion sizes were quite large - both starter and main dish.

Service was fast for drinks, starter and main dish. 

Quality of service from the staff was very good. 

The Not so Good:...A little pricey. This probably stems from next point. 

The place is on a pretty hidden part of VI. Not on a major road like many other places. As such I figure the turnover is low and maybe this causes prices to be higher than it might be to meet fixed costs.More",35,Aug-18,4,Utopia
Samir E,Bad food,"Visited with my gf, we ordered a pizza, fettuccine, and 2 starters.

Starters were OK, but the pizza was the worst pizza I've ever eaten. The cheese was smelly, told them it's not edible. They got me another one but it was equally as bad....Didn't eat it, and nor did we eat the fettuccine as it was horribly cooked.More",40,Apr-18,4,Utopia
DBVLagos2016,Great tasting food with a great atmosphere,"Tastefully decorated with very attentive staff (shout out to Vicky in particular), resident DJ (DJ Blumeflamez) spinning the decks through the night makes for a great atmosphere. Freshly cooked food whatever the time of day has saved me on more than one occasion. A visionary...owner, Walid Faddoul, has an eye for detail and with great food, a mix of Nigerian/Lebanese/International cuisine and good range of drinks and tunes - this place simply deserves more customers. Don‚Äôt take my word for it, try it soon!More",30,Mar-18,4,Utopia

Suzy x,"Good food, good service","I've tried a number of dishes on their menu and found them to be quite good. I must say I didn't like their pasta the one time I tried it and haven't had it since then. Might have improved. The ribs are good albeit quite...expensive, their suya is good etc. The service (in particular)and the ambience are great! Nice for a group of friends or a couple.More",40,Sep-17,4,Utopia
serenaa,The best ribs ever!,"My friend and I decided to meet at Utopia for Sunday lunch. It's tucked away in Victoria Island , clearly signposted, but only if you know where you are going. The ambience is comfy and the decor is retro. The waiting staff are knowledgeable of...the menu and pleasantly attentive. My previous attempts at sampling ribs in Nigeria have been lacklustre, but the waiter was encouraging when I enquirer about the ribs, so I decided to try...and OhmyGod!!! I'm so glad I did...it was a generous portion, moist, tender and coated in a delicious barbecue sauce...mmmmm...utterly yummy! I'll definitely be going back for more!More",40,Aug-17,4,Utopia

Roobel,Good Ambience. Food is good only if u choose wisely,"First of all the ambience is good. Comfortable. The sitting space is spaced out such that each group gets its own privacy, without the impression of any vacant void spaces. Excellent lighting.
