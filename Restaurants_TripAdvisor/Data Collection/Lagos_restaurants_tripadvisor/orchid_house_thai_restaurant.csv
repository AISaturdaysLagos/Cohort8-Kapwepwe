gracemS3434LQ,Their delivery lines are manned rude personnel. The owners must not care about service to customers.,Yesterday I called their line and a very rude man proceeded to tell me their delivery guy was too tired to deliver - this was 8pm.

TingSiong,Nice Thai foods and ambient,"Went there with my colleague for dinner on a weekday around 7:30pm. Ambient is nice. Ordered 2 appertisers, and for 3 main dishes with rice. Not so spicy which suits my colleague. However, they have got good spicy condiment if you want to spicy hot...to dip into. 

Good thai foods. I rate tom yum soup at 8/10. Pad Thai 9/10. The fish fillet appetiser and satay both 9/10. Total we spent 30k N (including 2 rounds of drinks)

Lore D,Verbally attacked by Asian Manager/Owner,"My husband and I have had a tradition of going to Orchid House Thai restaurant  in Victoria for our weekly date night. After date night on Friday, we decided to take a friend from the UK to get dinner on Sunday. We had an issue...with the meal we ordered, and while trying to explain this to the Asian manager or alleged owner, she began to yell at us and insisted we pay for a meal we could not eat. We ended up paying for the meal that we didn’t eat so as to not escalate the issue and calmly approached her to discuss better ways this situation could have been handled since absolutely no customer service skills were exercised. Instead of engaging in this conversation, the manager / owner raised her voice and yelled at us to leave, saying we got what we ordered. I ended up leaving hungry and out of four thousand Naira (plus tax) for a meal that was taken back to the kitchen. Terrible experience and we will not be back.More",50,May-19,4.5,Orchid House Thai Restaurant

Yinka O,Fight broke out,The manager asked her staff to kick us out because we wanted to split the bill and the staff proceeded to physically attack and insult us.,50,Oct-18,4.5,Orchid House Thai Restaurant
deepu s,Very disappointing worst experience,"We been to this restaurant with huge expectations searching of Thai restaurant, once we reach a server greeted us and took us to terrace open area. 

Ambience is good to relax so we ordered beer and GAI HO BAI TEY started which was good later...we ordered main course PENANG CURRY with rice which was really horrible (sorry to say), may be taste doesn’t suits us, but for which we complain we disappointed with the action taken. 

They forcefully make us to take that food but we asked them remove without even having 1/4 portion. Actually the disappointment part is customer service is very poor. 

We asked for manager but supervisor came to our table listen to our complaint and walk back, no apologies at least it’s a curtosey to react for customers complain. This is we’re loosing customers very easily. 

Actually I was expected to bring my group of friends by seeing ambience and starter, but service really disappointed as and will make us not to recommend this place as well. ThanksMore",40,Jan-19,4.5,Orchid House Thai Restaurant
