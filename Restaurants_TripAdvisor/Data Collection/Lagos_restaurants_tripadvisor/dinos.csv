Blackheart,Chaotic and filthy,"One of  about 4 eateries in he same vicinity, this is by far the worst. 

From the grumpy security to the loud and dusty interior with almost a pandemonium of disorganized chaos with a clear lack of supervision. The overall impression of ill-maintained filth is...reinforced by dirty toilets, no soap and a pungent smell that neither a dozen of naphthalene mothballs nor a couple of air fresheners can cover.

The personnel comes across as clueless and ill-trained, i had to wait quite some time for the cashier to finish disputing a preceding guest over first a faulty bill and then the lack of change.I could also not make out any supervisor!??

I opted for some fried plantain, a bean-stew with a boiled egg and heavily regretted a few hours later.........for violating my own rules of not eating in places I perceive as unhygienic !

Not again, at least not until there is fundamental improvement of the multiple challengesMore",20,Mar-19,2,Dinos
