Kayode O,Bad customer service,"My most recent experience was a total disappointment. The great meal at the restaurant was spoiled by the terrible customer service. The staff seems absolutely uninterested in helping me or answering any of my questions. Even when I expressed my concerns after leaving the restaurant,...little interest was shown . 
Finally, I would never suggest that anyone eat at this restaurant.More",40,Mar-23,4,Bistro 7

923emekab,Poor customer service,Dishes were dirty. The waiter didnâ€™t apologize at all for the dirty dishes. The food was okay not exceptional. The food wasnâ€™t worth the high price.,40,Jul-18,4,Bistro 7
Oyindamola F,Huge Portions,"The food is really nice but the portions are always a bit too large for me, so I end up leaving with takeout. Thatâ€™s a plus by the way :)",35,Apr-18,4,Bistro 7
Ade2566,They Get it Right!,"Always a favorite place for lunch or dinner. Bistro 7 has been able to keep its service quality quite high i must say during the times i have visited. Staff are friendly and the food is always well presented and not to delayed. I always...start with the mushroom soup and then do a tofu based meal (no longer offered :-( ).
They have a small coffee, cakes & pastry bar adjacent to the restaurant with some lounge seating.  Great place to have small short casual meetings.  Overall good fusion style food and caters to small and mid-sized groups comfortably. Do give a try when you are around the area.More",45,Oct-17,4,Bistro 7

262Blondy,Nice place inside,"Went there for brunch during week days. Very nice and cosy inside,but outside unluckily the construction work nearby was disturbing. May be evenings and weekends is better. Sleepy stuff, mistakes with order and waiting time more than an hour. I am sure stuff can do...better. The place have a potential and good menu choice for lunch/dinner.More",40,Mar-17,4,Bistro 7
Johnson M,Hidden jewel in Lagos,"At first look it was nothing from outside. Shabby surroundings and ordinary building in Victoria Island. When we walked in the door it became a different story. We discovered a cozy and beautiful loungy restaurant with open garden area. 
Was looking for breakfast and this...place fulfill expectation nicely done  american breakfast and mouth watering pancake platter. 
Staff was attentive and smiley but i appreciate the manager (sunny) was caring and running up & down to every guest, very soft spoken and charming. 
I will recommend to all my friends and will definitely coming back again.ðŸ˜ŠMore",40,Mar-17,4,Bistro 7

Phearphire,Valentines bouquet,"I know this is a restaurant but they were doing bouquets for valentines and I got a bouquet of 100 roses for my wife from here, they were extremely friendly , efficient and the quality of bouquet they turned out for me was amazingly high...and the price was very fair. If this level of service mirrors to their restaurant I may very well be a regular in the near future.More",50,Feb-17,4,Bistro 7
