15,Andrew P,Big Birthday Bash,"Visited on a Sunday with my family. I should have taken the emptiness of the restaurant as a sign but still we proceeded thinking perhaps we will get even better service and yummy Italian food. 

I had been looking forward to trying it as it...is in a very popular hotel and that comes with hotel prices so I decided to go with family and let them pay! Haha. I had minestrone soup for starters and lasagne for my main (I had been looking forward to a scrumptious meal). We pretty much had hot tasteless water as minestrone (super disappointed) and I had a burnt slice of lasagne which was tasty but it had burnt edges like it has been left a bit too long in a microwave. The food took a while to come out from the kitchen and we wondered why as we were the only 3 in the restaurant. Smh. It was NOT worth the money or the time. 

Perhaps other people have had better luck or we went on an ""off"" day, ah well..... Never again. Moving on.

44,Y6571FYandyc,Fantastic with a couple of minor gripes,"A first class dining experience with just one or two gripes. The service is excellent, the menu provides ample choice for all pallettes, the food quality is first class and its a very nice setting.

I have been there three times recently, with a friend,...on my own and as part of a group. On the first occasion I went on a Thursday to find that there is a live band each night from Thursday to Sunday inclusive. The volume interferes with sociable discussion so we moved upstairs to a lounge bar. The lounge bar is a very nice setting and affords a little more privacy than the main restaurant downstairs. You can still hear the band is not as intrusive as downstairs.

On my second visit, on my own, the restaurant was five minutes away from a perfect review. The music upstairs was fine and being played at a sensible volume. After I asked for the bill, one of the bar staff decided to play naija 'music' very loud. This took the edge off the experience.

On my most recent menu, the waiter taking the order either didn't hear my request for rice or forgot about it. Consequently, the curry and the bread came without the rice. I mentioned it to the manager (more about him later) and when the rice came he added an additional dish at no extra charge.

On the way out and thanked him for his gesture and told him that someone who understands that the recovery is more important than the mistake is a customer service champion. And he is... helpful, attentive, responsive and dedicated to ensuring a great customer experience.

Given the most recent experience I would suggest that the waiters repeat the order back to the customer to ensure nothing is missing.

My only other gripe us that the drinks are expensive compared to other Indian restaurants but I guess they have to pay for the setting!

Overall, a fantastic restaurant, great food, excellent service and a manager who understands customer service. Highly recommendedMore",4.5,2022-11-01,4.5,343 Degree North Restaurant and Lounge

Today was all far past my expectations....We were welcomed by the hostess at the front door who led us to our table. 

The manager was kind enough to come over and talk us through the menu and dishes. 

The waiters was well versed with what‚Äö√Ñ√¥s popular and a must order.

The food was fantastic and presented very well. The biryani was somewhat different than that of an Indian pallet but that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s why that call it Indian Fusion. Frankly I loved it, suites my pallet just fine. 

Value for money, well you really can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t go wrong. We ate to the brim and it cost us 14k per head. What more can you ask for.

56,Y6571FYandyc,A Huge Disappointment,"I visited at around 9pm on a Tuesday. The first challenge is to negotiate a worryingly steep staircase of thin stairs once thus has been achieved you find yourself in a well appointed, spacious, nicely decorated lounge. Like every other restaurant / bar / lounge...in Lagos I was also greeted with music being played at an unnecessarily loud volume. To avoid this, I noticed a side lounge where the impact of the music was lessened. This space is especially good for people who suffer from light sensitivity issues as you sit on a virtual darkness. I was given a menu and trying to read the small print in the dark proved a fruitless exercise so I downloaded the menu on my phone and ordered a sangria and a chicken burrito. The sangria was not a sangria but a sangria posing as a frozen margarita. I have had sangria in three countries and have never before had a mountain of ice in my glass. The impact of this was twofold - firstly, true to Archimedes Principle, the weight of the ice has the impact of raising the level of the sangria to the rim of the glass which makes negotiating it in the dark a wet, sticky experience and secondly dealing with the first problem by sucking through a straw delivers 'brain freezer. Luckily, the darkness spared the other diners from witnessing my head holding pain!!

The food arrived and looked OK. I moved to a higher table to reduce the distance from plate to mouth (given the attendant perils of dining in the dark). As for the food, the chicken burrito tasted like it should, the refried beans tasted like they should and the rice tasted like it should. It would have been very good but for one thing. There was not a single hot (or even warm thing) on my plate. At this point I decided to eat it as presented, pay the bill and go. I'm sad to say it was a nightmare in the dark. However I'm nothing if not balanced so it's only fair to point out that the service was responsive, helpful and unobtrusive and the setting is very nice. I suspect it gets livelier and noisier later on. Buy the bottom line is that I wanted a quiet, tasty hot meal in a nice setting.

57,Tia011,I cannot believe they get away with this,"I am livid as i write, I generally don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t give up on a restaurant after 1 bad experience but this place was just disgusting. We ordered a takeaway. 

I ordered the signature wings and seafood platter. 
I cannot describe the nasty refried rubbish with bits...missing we were presented with. The food looked like frozen food deep fried, i tasted one mouthful then had to bin it and make alternative arrangements for our food.

The real insult is that a platter implies an assortment of items described in the menu. Ladies and gentlemen- look at the picture and see the rubbish we were served in a standard sized plastic container. Notice no sole no spring rolls and the rubbery disgusting food costs N19,600 for this rubbish. There were two jumbo prawns and stodgy mass produced calamari and sticky clumps of pastry. The prawn was like rubber covered in sellotape doused in salt. I have never tasted such awfulness in my life.

I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t comprehend the good reviews, we eat out very often but this amongst  the worst food we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve ever been presented with. It was badly described, poorly cooked and shoddily presented. 

There is no justification for this, they had no signature wings. Their response when I complained was could they bring it to me tomorrow!!! Totally clueless and inept customer service. It seems to me that  are taking advantage of their position in VI to serve unimaginative, tasteless food. Yucky on every level!

Decor is subtle but overall a really well presented restaurant. 

The staff must have been especially selected and I could not possibly fault the service received.

Although steak is the primary dish there are other sections too so The Grill can cater for all tastes. Unless you particularly desire the American steak the South African steak is fine and comes in at considerably less cost.

We both selected the SA tenderloin medium-rare and cannot fault the way in which it was cooked and presented. Delicious meal and a superb way to finish off our Nigeria experience.  We accompanied the steak with glass of house red each and a bottle of room temperature water. All up Naira34,000 for the two of us. Given the quality of the meal, service and location, well worth it.

84,robertgB5456BA,A melt in your mouth Perfectly cooked steak.,"The Grill located at Eko Hotel, Lagos Nigeria provided us the setting for our 24th wedding anniversary. We opted for a South African tenderloin steak cooked medium rare accompanied by a bottle of Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir. Arriving at about 19:20 we were the only...ones being seated and through the evening only two other tables became occupied. Potentially this could have led to an over attentive staff hovering around the table. This was not the case at all. Indeed there was just the right amount of attention given to the dinning experience. There is a huge price differential between the American and South African steak and this swayed us to the South African. The steak was ordered medium rare and it was lightly seared on the outside providing that flame grilled texture and flavour whilst the rest simply melted in your mouth. It was stunning and rates amongst the bests steaks to have been on my plate. Price all up with starter, main and bottle of wine was in the order of US$290.

100,PeterS13034,My favourite Lebanese restaurant in Lagos!,"I often wish we could split our reviews between the food and the service. I often feel it's wrong to punish the one because of the other.
Firstly, the food was really good. We were 3 people having dinner and ordered about 10 different small...plates to share. These included Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Fatoush Salad, Lamb Kabob and Kibbeh to name a few. They all tasted really fresh, flavorful and were beautifully presented in a variety of decorative dishes. The accompanying flat breads were warm, freshly made and just delicious. 
We started off with drinks in the outside area which was nice and cool after the rain and then went inside. I loved the decor and the atmosphere. As another reviewer wrote, you are almost transported to the Middle East, if you can ignore the Western Pop music playing ?
As for the service, the manager was really attentive and friendly but he can't be everywhere all the time.  Drinks were forgotten, and we had to wave at the servers when we wanted refills of to order something else. As there were only 3 other tables besides us, I feel that they need to be a bit more aware. ( I also hate having to wave my arms like a mad person in a restaurant)
Definitely not a cheap evening out at 69 000Nira for 3 people (about $200 at today's exchange) but that's food and drink included.More",1.0,2017-05-01,4.0,Al Diwan Restaurant

Now, let's talk about the food: ssssoooooo delicious! The variety of dishes and how good and fresh they are, blew my mind. Humus, babaganoush, tabouli, and that's only to talk about the appetizers! Of course I haven't tried everything but I've asked for a copy of their menu so that I can pass an order and sometimes bring a couple of those dishes at home for the family!

While waiting for my food to arrive, some of the female waitresses were engaged in a loud and prolonged argument to the extent that I had to change my...seat (to get away from the noise) - this was both unprofessional and frankly speaking - ridiculous. Also noticed the waiters in general tend to congregate in groups (e.g. around some of the cash points) and gist away. 

The food however was timely and tasted fine, the drinks were just ok at best. Prices are reasonable and the ambience is nice, though for some reason it seemed the air conditioning wasn't cooling as it should on the day of my visit.

229,Ade2566,Casual Open Air Dining & Entertainment,"Bay lounge is a casual dining restaurant with an open air setting. While there is a covered seating option the fun and energy of Bay Lounge is best felt on the outside. Here on most nights from Wednesday through Saturday there is either a band...on stage (real stage) or comedy (Thursdays and Fridays). No booking is required but it does get busy and choice seats (lounge style) go quick.
Food is varied and most people can find something from local to continental dishes. For Vegetarians you will do well to ask what can be provided or create your own mix and march from the menu.
Bay lounge seats 3 doors away from Sailors lounge also another popular restaurant and open air dining.

Best kept secret on the menu is the Tiger prawns and garlic sauce. It's by far the best value by price and weight on the island and quite delicious too!

286,Ayo O,Affordable Tasty Meals,"Black Bell is a well located eatery on the busy Adeola Odeku street. The building facade and the interior are contemporary and very clean, and the parking lot takes about ten cars.

You may enjoy sweet treats from the bakery or help yourself to the...broad range of local delicacies from various parts of Nigeria. 

However, you may be required, mid-meal, to come out to relocate your vehicle. 
Furthermore, the serving staff members need to smile and exude warmth, as you wonder if they think their tasks drudgery

The latest additions include a number of South African dishes including boerewors and game steak which are flown in from RSA.

295,Damidj,Great Bulgarian Lebanese dining experience in Lagos,"Bulgarian and Lebanese cuisine under one roof might seem like an unlikely combination, but not to worry, it's not actually a fusion of the two cuisines. The menu just has both listed separately. So you can order a delicious Chicken Sofia or you can order...a classic Lamb Kofta - you decide. I thought that was pretty unique, and don't know that I have ever been to a Bulgarian restaurant, so this was a nice introduction. 

The restaurant itself, is well located off Ajose Adeogun in VI, and very easy to find. It sits on the corner of Younis Bashorun and Tiamiyu Savage. It has a really spacious interior and some outside seating as well. There are huge TV screens and some beer brand (Heineken, Gulder) sponsorships, which make me think it works well as a sports bar also. The wait staff are plentiful and very attentive, seriously I have been there twice and it always seems they are very overstaffed for the shift. So the ladies just seem to stand there and stare, with not much to do. They are friendly though, and are knowledgeable about the menu, which is a big plus. 

Now to the food, no complaints whatsoever. You have to try to hummus with meat, it is delicious and the meat is a nice addition. In the two times I've visited, my party and I have ordered the lamb kofta, seafood platter, chicken Sofia, and a sampling of some of the appetizers. And everything has been well made. I'm starting to think this might be one of the few Lagos restaurants that have a process down pat and can deliver on consistency.More",4.0,2019-07-01,4.5,B.L. Restaurant

The choices are pretty much what is expected from a high rate restaurant but what I...fell in love with is their Water Melons. Their fruit choices were absolutely exquisite.
The atmosphere that evening was lovely as the room was well lit yet subtle enough to give that elegant feel to each meal. Buffet style dinner and breakfast yet it looked specially cooked for you. 

The only down side to my experience was the breakfast chef who was making the omelets, who had the air of sheer arrogance about answering simple questions and doing his job. The line for what he was doing was quite long but his final output was worth the wait though.

The coffee choices wonderful; the array of fresh fruit juices was exceptional; the meat and chicken done right and finally the clean up was on time and professional.

1. Your...waiter gave us a different higher price for alcoholic drinks, wen we asked him why he was giving a different price from the menu he couldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t explain. We asked him to call the manager so she could explain what was going on. The manager was so down dress that we wondered how a manager could be dressed like that . 

2. The food was so small, that it didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even go round for everyone. Had to call the manager again to complain about how little the food was for the kind of money we paid . 
Ô£ø√º¬ß√Æ. 

3. As we rounded up the dinner, one of the waiters came to ask if any of us was driving a sliver Jeep because some thieves had broken the window of the car . 
We all quickly rushed downstairs to check and yes it was one of our cars. 
We asked the security what had happened and they really cannot explain anything because the car was parked right next to them. They gave one lame excuse that a car drove straight to Jeep, broke the window and stole the phone inside. 
It was clear that it was an inside job, cause how did the thief know that the was a cell phone in the car.?

I complaining bitterly about how they would set all to default inconveniencing the customers. The other customers behind me on the queue were also saying it was a silly idea to have all of their POS not giving debit options of type of account.

My SMILE and MTN data devices had network fluctuating from ‚Äö√Ñ√∫No service‚Äö√Ñ√π to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Limited service- one bar‚Äö√Ñ√π. 
 Angela with some other staff watched me for over 18minutes struggling to log on to my internet banking to transfer funds from one account to another since they lied they do not have POS that allows you to pick which account to debit. 
They were supposed to offer free WiFi to customers but she said that too was not available. 

After I successfully transferred the funds, I discovered she was lying, they had at least 3 other POS terminals that gave options of choosing which accounts you would like payment debited to. A customer watching the drama actually dumped his food, he was irritated and disappointed, they claimed they had no manager.

Service can be a bit slow especially on busy days/nights e.g. weekends, the staff and manager are quite attentive and friendly - for me, this is always a big plus since I'm a sucker for good customer service.

- Burger is ok but the patty is ridiculously thin, and there should definitely be more lettuce inside the burger. That would change the experience completely. Try to put some shredded lettuce instead - you‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll see it will please costumers.

I asked for two additional trays only to discover they were soiled and dirty (the girl apologized but didn't attempt to bring new ones.

It was the best decision I'd made in the last ten months. 
Initially we were both at a loss of how to employ...the QR code  menu,we insisted on hard copy ones which we got with smiles....obviously these grey heads are not up to date.
We decided on an entree of fried baby calamaris and a meal of medium well grilled filet Mignon.
Wow I tell you we had our socks blown off by the deliciousness of these plates,the calamari was crisp ,hot and delicate to the palate as expected while the steak was melt in your mouth beef with the loveliest black pepper sauce and fried rice as carbs.
I went back alone on a later date to have ice-cream...my choice was lemon cheese cake flavor,I so relished it it took me a whole hour to lick just one scoop.

Cafe Vanessa came...to mind as it was recently remodelled - it has seen quite a bit of life as Hole 19 and then Auto Lounge. 

For a Friday night, the place was quiet. Maybe that should have been a red flag. We sat down and it took years to get someone to come around and finally we got discovered. Orders were taken and like a bad habit, I asked for wait time, I was told 10 minutes. At first I wonder which restaurant serves in 10 minutes?

10 minutes passed. And then 20. And 30 minutes. Without much ado, nothing showed up for almost a hour. We didn't notice the passage of time because we had so much to talk about.

I was very upset but when I consider the trouble of leaving for somewhere else, I sucked it in. 

Food came and it was lovely. 

And then the bill, I was shocked - 20% service charge? In Lagos? I thought I was dreaming. Paid up and promised never to show up again. The charge was double insult as it was out of this world and considering we got a poor service, it was terrible.

the first thing you notice is that the restaurant has a musty stale smell .... There were very few people there . 
Had the meat Bbq... the beef was tough and very salty, and the chicken very...fatty. The lamb was okay. The buffet of salads and sides was very mediocre, scanty and not very appetizing looking or tasting.

Server: we're out madame. 
Me: for a few hours or until when? 
Server:...Tuesday 

Y'all! 

What works:
* Refried beans 
* Fajitas but not the bell peppers. They're bitter. 
* Live Band 
* Clean restroom 
* Outdoor patio 

What can improve:
* Separate the guac and sour cream for this price point they should arrive in their own ramekins. 
* More tortillas or make hand pressed flour tortillas instead of the store bought. It'd really elevate the fajitas.
* Prices. Although I recognize this is a hotel restaurant and they are catering to us travelers... TexMex is cost effective and accessible to all. The fine dining prices keep so many from enjoying the sabor desde TexMex.

1598,Y6571FYandyc,"Fish yes, chips yes. Fish and chips never!!","Coming from the land of fish and chips and wanting a taste of home I visited Crust and Cream specifically for a 'fish and chip' supper. What was presented to me was what appeared to be a pile of goujons with chips. The 'fish' was...chewy and flavourless, cooked in breadcrumbs rather than batter which added to the chewiness a long way distant from the crispness of authentic fish and chips. I had to request salt and vinegar which took an age to arrive and when it did was white vinegar not malt vinegar The price of this culinary disaster was over N8,000.
The following night I went and enjoyed 'proper' fish and chips with peas fir N4,000 at Churchills bar in Lekki. Crust and Creme should change the menu description to Fish Goujons to avoid misleading other diners into a miserable  eating experience and costly mistake.

- We have visited the restaurant  2 times in same week and we noticed differences in quality and sizes of the dishes (e.g. shrimp size & count served in Cesar Salad and Pasta). We checked with the responsible and he told us there was a change in the Chief during this week which may make that happened.

It's almost an exact replica of the Cubana in Victoria Island but in my view, this one has a more contemporary feel and look to it. There's a large outdoor sitting area...for those who prefer to eat outdoors (this has a garden-like feel); right next to the outdoor area is a small indoor sitting area (downstairs) for those who might prefer something a bit less rowdy. Lastly there's yet another restaurant (Rhapsody's) indoors and upstairs. This has a clean, upscale feel with different sitting sections, ideal for both small and large groups of diners. The food tasted great, though slightly pricey. The cocktails were great as well and at a much better price point. There's ample parking space outside as well. 

Overall I'd definitely recommend this place and will likely visit again.More",4.5,2020-02-01,4.5,Cubana Hut and Grill

The premise also houses a nite club called the Grind. I didn't however have the opportunity to go there.

I however have a few concerns as most of the parking spaces within the premises are reserved for valet parking so you probably have to park along the road.

Service was also not top notch as you will expect with most bars in Lagos on the island. Lastly the drinks weren't cold. Got warm after a few minutes of exposure. They certainly need to work on this if you are paying above average prices for drinks.

The personnel comes across as clueless and ill-trained, i had to wait quite some time for the cashier to finish disputing a preceding guest over first a faulty bill and then the lack of change.I could also not make out any supervisor!??

1853,iyoboi,Not worth it,"So this was one of the most disappointing experiences of my Lagos restaurant week experience. I went to this restaurant with high hopes mostly due to nostalgia from its past glory days. 

I had the hummus with meat and kibble for my starter. This was...the best part of the meal for me although the hummus was a little too salty. For my main I had the chicken escalope with fries. I honestly gave up after 2 bites. It was tasteless and I was unimpressed by the presentation. It looked like a cheese pizza honestly. For dessert, they only had the Lebanese sweet when there's also ice cream on the menu. I honestly wish I could have eaten it and judged it appropriately but I just couldn't get used to the texture. It looked like yougurt and tasted like partially frozen sweetened custard. Wasn't really into it. I wish I had gone to Sakura instead as they share a kitchen. 

All I have to say is NEVER AGAIN. Just happy I got a voucher and didn't have to pay for the food. Speaking of the voucher, the hostess almost refused to accept it insisting that we pay cash even though we had a voucher. After a couple of minutes back and forth, she eventually let us go. I guess they weren't properly informed.

I calles the Room Service- my first call the woman who answered the call said she will send someone in the room, after 40 mins no one come. So I called again and no one came to the room again. Third time I calles she said I should call the dury manager. I called the duty manager and after an hr someone came and  put as to another room- the whole process took us almost 3.5 hrs! 

We ordered for dinner- it took them more than 1 and a half he to bring the food and their white rice is terrible too! 

The bext morning i ordered for breakfast- the food came, but it is not complete, the bread did not come, the mushroom and ham were not served!!! We called room service and it took them an hr to bring the remaining food and ofcourse something is missing again. They just dont get the right thing the first time!

Lastly a #1stworld comment or description of my Croissant, which was tiny in size and tasted like white bread with a rubber band in the middle, it fell off my plate and bounced back up to the table, that was a joke but it was an insult to French cuisine to label it a croissant. I recall eating them for breakfast in Paris, dipping the fluffy pastry in my coffee and when your teeth bit through the crackly outside to the fluttery, tissue-thin layers beneath, you tasted butter with that hint of creamy sweetness that really good butter brings.

I immediately had a good feeling when I spotted this fancy Parisian eatery. The place oozed style and grace, from the...outside to the inside. The restaurant was cool, airy, bright, spotless and had a 'kick back & relax' vibe to it. The decor was contemporary, simple and tasteful. Eric Kayser Artisan Boulanger had a sizeable menu! They have everything from Breakfast, (with a big focus on eggs), Salads, Club Sandwiches, as well as Hot and Cold Sandwiches, Les Quiche Maison, Burgers, Pastas, Le Pizzeria (Du Boulanger), 'Proper' Dishes like Filet Mignon, Filet de Poisson, Chicken Milanese and Filet de Saumon. Other offerings include a dedicated Kids Meals, Frappes & Frozen Drinks, Hot Drinks, Fresh Drinks, Mocktails and a vast array of phenomenal desserts! 

I ordered the KAYSER QUICHE (goat cheese & chicken). This was accompanied by a robust side salad. We also got the CHICKEN PANINI (roast chicken breast, french mustard, tomato & mozarella); both my hubby and I. He got the LABNEH PLATE (labneh, zaatar, cucumbers, tomatoes & olives). For drinks, I got the VIRGIN PINA COLADA. LOTUS CHEESECAKE and CREME BRULEE was our dessert. I must say that everything tasted out of this world delicious! Ô£ø√º√≤√£ The food 'reeked' of freshness and quality; pure perfection! Ô£ø√º√´√ßÔ£ø√º√®Œ© Service was awesome. Every staff member was courteous, diligent and professional. What really blew me away about Eric Kayser Boulanger was the absolutely insane amount of desserts and pastries that were available for purchase over the counter. It was as if I had been transported to the streets of Paris and had wondered into one of their very many wonderful cafes or boulangeries! Ô£ø√º√≥¬∫Ô£ø√º√≤√Ö Is it any wonder why this phenomenal restaurant can be found in over 20 countries, on 6 different continents? 

It is worth mentioning that Eric Kayser Artisan Boulanger sells so many incredible desserts, which are beautifully displayed in multiple show glasses. These include Muffins, Brownies, Macaroons, Chouquettes, Strawberry/Nutella Beignet (Doughnuts), Mini Viennoise, Creme Brulee (regular & chocolate), Meringues, Chocolate/Vanilla/Coffee/Nutella Eclairs and Apricot Sable. 'Dreamy' Cakes include Opera, 'Le Kayser', Delice Coco, Three Chocolate, Millenium, Crousty and Moka. There's also a fantastic selection of tarts like Lemon, Coconut, Strawberry, Almond, and so much more. Cheesecake flavors include Blueberry, Lotus and Mixed Berry. 

The 'plethora' of assorted breads and savory bakes & pastries is simply to die for! Ô£ø√º√ß√ªÔ£ø√º‚Ä¢¬ÆÔ£ø√º‚Ä¢√±Ô£ø√º‚Ä¢√™ Seriously, you will be spoiled for choice here! These include, but are not limited to all kinds of Baguettes, Granola Bread, Brown Bread, Sourdough Bread, Raisin/Nut Bread, Campagne, Almond/Zaatar/Nutella Croissants, Flute Cheese, Langue de Chat and Brioche Tresse. Vegetarian 'Kayser', Salmon Quiche and the very famous Quiche Lorraine are available for purchase directly from the show glass. I must also give an 'honorable mention' to the Gelato that is sold at Eric Kayser. Flavors I saw were Raspberry, White Chocolate, Bounty, Mango, Amarena, Strawberry, After 8, Malaga, Cheesecake, Bailey's, Pineapple, 'Shtroump' (blue, Smurf's-inspired ice cream), 3 Chocolate, Banana and Unicorn (for kiddies). 

So in conclusion, I had a most impressive experience at Eric Kayser Artisan Boulanger, because not a single thing was amiss in this terrific restaurant. It was so refreshing to not know what to expect because I had never heard of this apparently very well known Parisian chain, and I'm thrilled to say that it did not disappoint whatsoever! I now have a new food joint to 'hit' whenever I visit my favorite city in Nigeria, therefore I eagerly anticipate returning to Eric Kayser, if not for anything, but for the superb spread of the most amazing looking pastries, ice cream, baked goods and treats that I have no doubt in my mind will be mind-blowing, sinfully delicious! Fantastic French Eatery in the heart of Victoria Island that will be worth your while to visit. Trust me, you will not regret coming to Eric Kayser Artisan Boulanger!

1888,RitzAroundTheWorld,A breath of 'French' air Ô£ø√º√≤√ß!,"Okay...so I've never been to France...therefore the thought of a Parisian restaurant in Victoria Island, Lagos excited me a bit. Let's just say I was impressed by the speed of getting my plate done and served, especially as it seemed like a very busy Sunday...evening - what with the footfall in the restaurant. 

Anyway...I went with my BFF and the staff were really nice - from the (free) valet parking staff to the COVID-19 regulation compliant staff; all the way from the door to the waiters and counter attendants. They were really courteous throughout (observing COVID-19 protocol from beginning to the end of our stay at the restaurant, such that we felt really comfortable eating there without fear of getting droplets in our food). They showed that they truly cared.

My friend and I ordered our meals and actually timed the waiters - meals took less than 20 minutes (drinks came earlier). We were quite impressed.

The staff were on their toes making sure everything went well. At some point my friend complained to another waiter about not getting the right sting in the hot sauce that came with her meal...not realising that the original waiter who attended to us was observing. This original  waiter quickly came to us, liaised with the other waiter and brought the spicy sauce. I just thought that is a bit rare these days.

It's also a modern restaurant where you get to scan the menu QR code to place your order. Good luck to you if you're still living in the past Ô£ø√º√≤√ë.

Long story short 40 minutes later, waiter comes back again to inform us that the sushi chef is on a break and he wants to find out if they go ahead with the hot meal. All the manager had to say was he didn't know we ordered sushi and I simply asked him what he assumed we came to do at their empty restaurant of he couldn't even make sure an order went through. The damn restaurant wasn't busy. Just don't go to this restaurant except you are looking to waste your time and money and eat average sushi.

The first...hiccup was the lack of cold bottled beer requiring us to buy the more expensive canned version (which was not particularly cold). We ordered three dishes from the menu; Ginjerki - the self proclaimed signature dish along with patatas bravas and empanadillas. The food was good as was the service. The patatas bravas were a disappointment replacing the traditional spicy tomato sauce with a barely spicy mayonnaise. The Ginjerki was the best value for money dish and the empanadillas were ridiculously over priced. The service was good and a nice touch was that the owners came over to talk to us. Overall an ok dining experience but they have to decide whether they want to be a traditional Spansh Tapas bar or something else. And the pricing needs sorting out!

2140,Wabe1816,"Flavorful, Economic Sunday Brunch","I dined at this establishment with a few coworkers for Sunday brunch. There were a variety of dishes available; however, the absence of cards with food descriptions in English made it difficult to truly enjoy the fare. All of the signs were in transliterated Hindi,...which was not helpful for people, like myself, who do not speak/read/understand Hindi. None of my co-workers could figure out the content of the dishes. As a result, we had to test a bit of everything, which turned out to be an uncomfortable experience as many of the dishes were very spicy/hot. Another downside is that the restaurant did not have mango lassi, which is an Indian restaurant staple. Overall, the price of the brunch is relatively economic - everything in Lagos that isn't Nigerian is expensive - and the food was relatively tasty. I would not partake in the buffet again, though, as I barely got through one plate.  Nevertheless, I would buy a dish a la cart.More",4.0,2019-07-01,4.0,Gurunar's Viceroy Restaurant

3194,abboudhiba,Perfect date,"I had heard so much about Izanagi when it first opened up some years back. There was a lot of hullabaloo about a fine dining sushi place that had opened up in Lagos, and I have looked forward to trying it ever since. The reviews...were great, yet I never got an opportunity to dine at Izanagi whenever I came to Lagos until now. Izanagi is part of The Blowfish Group. This 'business entity' prides itself in bringing ""hospitality and leisure"" of high, international standards to Lagos State. The Blowfish Group comprises of La Veranda Italian Cuisine Restaurant, The Purple Restaurant, 9-7 Supermarket, Mashawi Lebanese Grill, The Blowfish Hotel, Velvett Grill and Lounge and Izanagi Japanese Restaurant of course. These establishments seemed to mostly be located on or around the same street, in a quiet part of Victoria Island.  Great location I must say. 

Izanagi is your 'one stop shop' for authentic Japanese cuisine. The restaurant's sign/logo- (from the outside), advertises ""sushi, teriyaki, teppanyaki & noodles"". It's located on the second floor, and one of the other Blowfish Group's restaurants is situated on the first floor, (Vellvet Grill and Lounge I think). Izanagi's decor was done in an elegant Japanese theme, extremely posh and impressive! The restaurant had plush, mostly teal, rich purple, green, yellow and gray chairs, done in a classy, contemporary flair. It had light wooden floors and I loved the occasional imagery of vibrant Geishas inside and outside the restaurant. Tables were made of solid, dark marble. Izanagi had an open kitchen, and it's always pretty neat to be able to catch a glimpse of the restaurant's Chefs working their 'culinary magic' behind the counter! Ô£ø√º√´¬ÆÔ£ø√º√®Œ©‚Äö√Ñ√ßÔ£ø√º√ß‚â•

There was a sizeable outdoor seating area right by the entrance. Izanagi's interior had an interesting combination of formal and informal seating arrangements, which I thought was really cool!Ô£ø√º¬ß¬©  It was like a series of mini living rooms, casual bars, cozy diners,  etc scattered all over. It seemed that you could pick and choose the sort of 'mood/setting' you wanted feel when you dined here. Izanagi oozed flair, class and sophistication, yet was casual, all at the same time. The restaurant is really beautiful, excruciatingly clean, well maintained, and ambiance is 'off the chain'! ‚Äö√µ√¨Ô£ø√º√¥√ñÔ£ø√º√®√¶‚Äö√Ñ√ß‚Äö√¥√Ñ√î‚àè√® Their toilet was spotless and had a fancy, modern, grey marble sink- (refer to my posted pictures). 

So now, on to the food!Ô£ø√º√ß¬•Izanagi's menu is quite varied. The hard copy menu was glossy, colorful and had a picture of just about every food item listed. The drinks & beverages were featured on an iPad. They had Salads, Soups, Starters, Soup (cooked), Robatayaki, Dumplings, Tempuras, Dumplings, Soba Noodles, 'Special From The Grill' options, Rice, Sashimi, Izuzukuri, Nigiri Sushi, Hozo Maki, Ura Maki, Gunkan Sushi, Crispy & Panko Ura Maki, Zumo Maki, 'Special' Izanagi, Temaki, Desserts and so much more! The choices were so vast, that I had a hard time making my final selections! Ô£ø√º√≤√ë For the sushi, I ordered CRISPY SHRIMP (breaded shrimp & sakano sauce), IZANAGI ROLL (shrimp, crab, eel, togarashi), PLANTAIN MAKI (tuna, cream cheese, plantain, chives, crispy tempura) and TEMPURA HAND ROLL (ebi tempura, cucumber, garlic mayo). For my mains, I went for the CALAMARI TEMPURA (tender strips of calamari lightly dusted and fried, served with a side of salt, black pepper & a spicy dipping sauce) and IZANAGI FRIED RICE (chicken, shrimps, assorted vegetables). My drink was a mocktail called BERRY CAIPIRINHA (mixed berries, limes & apple juice). For dessert, I got the TEMPURA CHEESECAKE (cheesecake fried in tempura batter and drizzled with Izanagi's caramel, chocolate and strawberry sauce), though I declined the chocolate sauce because it tastes bitter to me sometimes. 

The Crispy Shrimp, Izanagi Roll and Plantain Maki were really good! Ô£ø√º√≤√£ As good as you would expect sushi to be in a professional, legit Japanese food outlet such as Izanagi. The ingredients were fresh and on point! Ô£ø√º√´√•Ô£ø√º√®Œ© The Tempura Hand Roll was nice, but the seaweed that it came wrapped in was dry and lacked that soft, sticky consistency that quality, fresh seaweed is known for. The Calamari Tempura I found to be too bland, though it had a delicate, chewy texture and was fried to golden perfection. I honestly expected a tad bit more flavor, although it was served with miniature saucers of rock salt and 2 other dipping sauces, so perhaps I was expected to dip the calamari in them to enhance/add to the flavor??? The Fried Rice was disappointing. It was rather tasteless, and even adding my own special home-made, dry chilli spice to 'jazz it up' couldn't 'redeem' it whatsoever. It looked so much better than it tasted. This rice looked incredible live and in print- (refer to the photo I posted). The rice's chicken- cut into chunks were way too big. They looked dark, (like bits of beef), and had that 'been in the freezer for too long' taste, which is tantamount to an ingredient not being fresh. The shrimps in the rice on the other hand were delicious, juicy and succulent. Isn't Japanese rice cooked teppanyaki style? This cooking method usually makes what is cooked packed with lots of flavor. Overall, I didn't enjoy this dish. My Berry Caipirinha was great! It was fruity and refreshing. It was served in a mason jar and filled with whole mint leaves and garnished with lemon slices and a strawberry. This yummy mocktail looked so appealing and too pretty to drink; (check out the picture of it that I posted) Ô£ø√º√ßœÄÔ£ø√º√≤√ß 

Last, 'and certainly least'- the Tempura Cheesecake. The waiter that tended to me told me that the cheesecake in this dessert was stored in the freezer, then fried in tempura batter- which I knew of course. I've had Tempura Cheesecake on a number of occasions and I know it to be sinfully delicious; a luscious, delectable marriage of hot and cold, 'sweet' and 'savory', smoothness and crunchiness. Izanagi's Tempura Cheesecake was atrocious! It was grainy, lacked any creaminess and tasted like it had been made with saccharine, aspartame or one of those low-calorie artificial sweeteners. And on top of that, it also tasted like a semi bitter medicine. It was also frozen rock solid, therefore too hard to be cut by my metal utensils! The tempura batter that enveloped the cheesecake was crispy and crunchy, but it couldn't 'salvage' the horrible cheesecake within! Ô£ø√º√≤¬¥ This is afterall a Japanese Restaurant, so I would expect them to whip up an excellent tempura batter. Ô£ø√º√≤√¢ Because I had been informed that the cheesecake came directly from the freezer, I gave it a few minutes to 'thaw' a little, but nevertheless, it was still frozen when I tried to eat it many minutes later. This turned out to be a tedious task and I had to go, so I simply gave up and left a huge chunk of this hot 'n' cold mess uneaten! The Tempura Cheesecake looked divine though, Ô£ø√º√≤√ß (refer to the picture I posted). It gave a whole new meaning to the phrase 'looks can be deceiving'! The fact that I didn't consume the cheesecake in it's entirety seemed to bother the restaurant's Supervisor, (who I'll talk about later). It's such a shame because I've had many a delicious Tempura Cheesecakes in the past, and was so looking forward to this one, being the 'sweet tooth' that I am. 

The service at Izanagi is worth mentioning. The waiter that served me was AFEEZ. Though polite and knowledgeable about the menu, Afeez was just about the most lifeless and dull restaurant employee I've ever encountered. He had a permanent deadpan expression plastered across his face the entire time I was at Izanagi. Nevertheless, he did seem to do his job to the best of his ability. At the tail end of my meal, along comes CHRIS. Chris was Izanagi's Supervisor. He was great! Super friendly, courteous and diligent. We chatted a little and he told me that the restaurant has been open for exactly 9 years. Can't believe it's been that long since I started hearing all the commotion about Izanagi! He also told me Afeez was new; so perhaps this 'newbie' was yet to 'break into his job'. Prices at Izanagi are reasonable; at least according to Lagos standards. Though from everyone's experience- (I'm sure), every bill tends to somehow 'add up' when you order multiple items from any menu. As my luck would have it, I coincidentally ran into a relative who was dining there with a friend, and I was informed by Chris that he had settled my bill before he left! Ô£ø√º√´√®Ô£ø√º√®Œ© Therefore, I have no idea how much I would have paid since I ate 100% on the house! Ô£ø√º√¥√ñÔ£ø√º√®√¶‚Äö√Ñ√ß‚Äö√¥√Ñ√î‚àè√®

So, my 'culinary adventure' at Izanagi turns out to be  mediocre at best. I guess this place didn't 'live up to the hype'; at least for me. Thank heavens I didn't have to pay for this meal! Ô£ø√º√≤√á The Fried Rice was a big let down, as was the overly brittle seaweed of the Tempura Hand Roll; and don't even get me started on the 'monstrosity' that was their Tempura Cheesecake! Ô£ø√º√≤¬© The sushi was really good, (as it should be), but I can't necessarily say that Izanagi is exactly the 'gold standard' for Japanese cuisine, most especially since they screwed up a Fried Rice! Ô£ø√º√´√©Ô£ø√º√®Œ©Service, (with the 'polar opposite' demeanors/personality's of Afeez and Chris), was a 'mixed bag'. Regardless of the 'lackluster' experience I had, it won't deter me from visiting Izanagi again. Perhaps I will strictly stick to their sushi next time- which seems to be their strength. Taking the entire experience into consideration, an average rating will have to 'suffice' for Izanagi. I was looking to be 'blown away' at this restaurant that I eagerly anticipated, but unfortunately, I was not. I soooooo wanted to rate them highly, but in all honesty- I just can't do that! I have to give an honest 'testament' to this eatery that I had such high hopes about. I do however have to consider the fact that this is indeed a top spot for authentic Japanese cuisine, the beauty and grace of the restaurant, the expansive menu, ideal location, great beverage and the 3 world-class sushis that I had, plus lots of other positive elements like Chris's awesome professionalism. Want to give a loud shout out to CHRIS and say a big thank you to him for his amazing service. AFEEZ needs to work on his 'dowdy' demeanor. I will hopefully return to Izanagi one day and try to sample the wide array of sushis they have. Hope they will read this detailed review meticulously and endeavor to improve upon the 'issues' I outlined on this medium. Here's hoping I will have a better experience next time!More",5.0,2020-10-01,4.5,Izanagi

3430,NaijaBabe2016,Victoria Island Branch (Adeola Odeku Street).,"Jade Palace is one of the better Chinese restaurants in the Lagos. It's been around for a while, which is always a good indicator, meaning that it has 'stood the test of time' in a city that has tons of competition in the Chinese cuisine...department. There are 2 branches, one in Victoria Island and one in Ikeja. We visited the V.I branch, which is located on the bustling, busy street known as Adeola Odeku.

The restaurant is located on the second floor of the building. Jade Palace is quite expansive, clean and appropriately decorated with bright red & gold oriental decor. Tables are set in a formal fashion. It looked oh so elegant and classy. The menu is something else! A very vast array of foods were on offer. Everything from dim sum to soups to cold/hot appetizers, sizzling and non-sizzling mains of beef, chicken, pork, fish, shrimp, other seafood, plus vegetarian options, rice, noodles, desserts and plenty of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. There was a glossy, vibrant picture of almost every item right next to it, which makes customers choices easier; (refer to posted pictures). Our waiters were a bit aloofish and not very engaging, though they were 'handsomely' dressed. None of them wore name tags.

We ordered BUTTERFLY KING PRAWNS CUTLET, DEEP FRIED PRAWN SPRING ROLLS WITH MAYONNAISE, FRIED PRAWNS WITH SWEET & SOUR SAUCE, SLICED BEEF WITH BROCCOLI IN OYSTER SAUCE, FRIED RICE WITH SHREDDED CHICKEN, FRIED NOODLES WITH ASSORTED VEGETABLES and CHAPMAN. The food was very impressive, however the 'stand out' dishes were the Prawn & Mayonnaise Spring Rolls and the Sweet & Sour Prawns. They were amazing! The Fried Noodles didn't look anything like it's photo in the menu and didn't taste great. The Sliced Beef and Fried Rice also fell a bit flat, plus the Chapman wasn't very refreshing or sweet enough. Though we enjoyed the Butterfly Prawns, they were a tad bit oily. 

We really enjoyed our dining experience at Jade Palace.  It's worth mentioning that the service here is super speedy! I don't think it took it took more than 5 minutes for the Spring Rolls and Butterfly Prawns to emerge, so J.P gets top marks for speed! Service by the waiters was diligent and professional, though like I said earlier, they should make an effort to be a bit friendlier. I look forward to returning to Jade Palace Restaurant some time soon because the food is actually very good, regardless of a few 'hiccups'. I highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you happen to be in the Victoria Island area and are craving authentic Chinese cuisine. Great restaurant!

The food wasn't nice - the spring rolls were thick and not tasty. The chicken in black bean sauce was ok but the prawns in chili wasn't nice either. 

The worst part of the evening though was that a group of people were having dinner in the private rooms and were making so much noise. They kept coming out of the room and yelling and shoving at each other - we got the impression that they were really drunk. It seemed like a fight was about to break out any minute! The noise was unbelievable.

The waiters/restaurant management were unable to control the situation. When they left we were told that they were staff of Huawei who were there to celebrate an event.

Ô£ø√º√´√•Ô£ø√º√®Œ©Ô£ø√º√´√®Ô£ø√º√®¬∫Ô£ø√º√´√ßÔ£ø√º√®Œ©,"Jamski has become a must-visit location for me when in Lagos- (which is a rarity). Ever since I tried Jamski's sublime cuisine for the first time last year, I was totally hooked! Island Food- (most notably Jamaican Fare), is one of my favourite cuisines. And...it's worth mentioning that this particular type of food is hard to come by anywhere in Nigeria, so coming to Jamski is always a special treat for me. I met the amazingly delightful PAPA JAMSKI last year and his fabulous daughter PRINCESS JAMSKI. Their charm, friendliness, presence and extraordinary personality is 'the icing on the cake' at Jamski! This 'dynamic duo' are some of the loveliest people you will ever meet! Ô£ø√º√≤√ß They make the experience at Jamski all the more pleasurable and memorable! Ô£ø√º‚Ä¢‚àû

My daughter had never tried Jamaican Food, so I decided to order some of their most famous and enduring classics. I'm familiar with Jamski's very varied menu, to which I gave a very detailed description in my last/first review of the restaurant. For this visit, we went for ESCOVITCH FISH (Rice, Peas, Plantain), a side of JERK CHICKEN and an OXTAIL MEAL (Rice, Peas, Plantain). For our drinks, we got one SORREL and one COCONUT WATER. We also ordered BEEF PATTY and CHICKEN PATTY, (2 each), for take-away. As usual, everything was simply delicious- packed with all those vibrant, tropical, spicy, Islandy flavours I love about Jamaican Food!Ô£ø√º√≤√£ The Jerk Chicken was slightly dry and underseasoned. It didn't taste fresh, and it was like it hadn't been marinated for some time prior to grilling, so the seasoning(s) didn't penetrate the chicken. I found the Oxtail, Escovitch Fish, Rice & Peas and Patties to be absolutely sumptuous. My daughter thought the Escovitch Fish lacked flavor, but loved the vinegary pickled vegetables on top, and the hints of coconut in the Rice & Peas. She also thought the Sorrel (Zobo) drink was too pepperish. My Coconut Water tasted very ordinary.

So again, the experience at Jamski ends up being another 'slam dunk'- (at least as far as I'm concerned). It seems that in my eyes, Jamaican Cuisine can do no wrong; especially when you get to interact with hosts as exemplary as PAPA JAMSKI and PRINCESS JAMSKI. The folks here are simply wonderful! Ô£ø√º√´√®Ô£ø√º√®¬∫ It's always so nice to see these incredible people, and I'd like to say a big thank you to them for catering to us so well as usual, and for all their warmth and TLC. The prices at Jamski are very competitive. We payed under 30 thousand naira for our food, including an extra Chicken Meal for our Chauffeur. I'm also thrilled that my daughter got to sample Jamaica Cuisine. She was very impressed by it, and finally understand why I fuss so much about it! Ô£ø√º√≤√ë I look forward to hopefully visiting Jamski yet again, (the next time I visit Lagos); perhaps with a different family member! The food here is so authentic and impressive, so please endeavor to check out Jamski- Home Of The Jamaican Patty.......and so much more!!!More",4.5,2022-08-01,4.5,Jamski

3480,NaijaBabe2016,JAMAICAN CUISINE @ IT'S ABSOLUTE FINEST!!! Ô£ø√º‚Ä¢√™ Ô£ø√º√ß√∫ Ô£ø√º‚Ä¢√≤ Ô£ø√º√ß√µÔ£ø√º√ßœÄ,"Jamaican Food is one of my favorite types of cuisine ever.  I knew about Jamski Restaurant, because my husband once brought me some yummy Jamaican Patties from them.  I hardly ever visit Lagos; so when I happened to do so, Jamski was most definitely on...my 'bucket-list' of places to visit.  First and foremost, I have to give an 'honorable mention' to PRINCESS.  I had difficulty locating Jamski, so I ended up calling the restaurant for directions.  Princess was of such tremendous help to me. Her seamless 'relatability and connectivity' is an irrefutable asset to any establishment!  She never hesitated to pick up my calls and was unwavering in her determination to get me to Jamski! Ô£ø√º√´√ßÔ£ø√º√®Œ© Princess is a total Angel, Ô£ø√º√´¬∫Ô£ø√º√®Œ© and I truly appreciate her assistance.

When I did eventually find Jamski, it was such an adorable gem of a place; almost a shack-like eatery.  Jamski is a lively, high-spirited environment, what with all the vivid and radiant imagery depicted throughout.  Green, yellow and black- (the colours of the Jamaican flag) were dutifully and liberally used all over Jamski.  The islandy, tropical decor of Jamski came in the form of stunning murals and oil murals in naturalistic outdoor settings, which adorned the interior, as well as the exterior.  This captured an upbeat, festive Carribean vibe. It was all so, so legit and authentic! Ô£ø√º√≤√Ö  I particularly loved the bold images the bold images of everybody's favorite 'Son of Jamaica' BOB MARLEY!  One was outside and one was inside, (refer to pictures posted).  Just catching a glimpse of the image of this global cultural, legendary musical icon, always puts me in a great mood!  I consider this cornerstone of Jamaican Pop Culture, Pioneer of Reggae Music, Heroic Advocate of Pan-Africanism to be one of the coolest people that ever lived! Ô£ø√º√≤√© Ô£ø√º¬ß√ªÔ£ø√º√®Œ©

Inside Jamski Restaurant, you had pictures/portraits of star athletes and Olympic Gold Medalists hanging on the wall, and a bold image of  Usain Bolt striking his trademark 'lighting bolt' or 'to di world' pose.  A gigantic map of Jamaica was an interesting visual treat to perceive.  There were 2 parts to Jamski Restaurant; one seemed to be a bit more casual- (located by the entrance), and the interior part, a bit more cozy and intimate.  The National Anthem of Jamaica was on full display, and Jamski's placemats were of the Jamaica flag.  The words 'One Love' also made a notable 'cameo' on a high wall.  I also adored how the ""J"" in Jamski's title had on a Tam (Rastacap)- the crocheted, colored cap typically associated with the Rastafari lifestyle! All these heart-warming Jamaican accoutrements and memorabilia lent an uplifting, cool ambiance to Jamski.  It's worth mentioning that I ran into the owner of Jamski. His name was PAPA JAMSKI. This delightful gentleman was absolutely lovely!  He was charming, funny, jovial, cordial, accommodating, warm-hearted, and super pleasant!  I enjoyed chatting with him, and he made me feel very welcome.  PRINCESS was so lovely as well.  She was so professional, friendly and hospitable.  What a fantastic family! Ô£ø√º√≤√ß

The menu at Jamski Restaurant is out-of-this-world amazing!  The hard copy menu itself is an attractive, colorful, glossy affair with a picture of every single food item on the menu. Very visually descriptive!  This makes it easy for customers who aren't too familiar with Jamaican Cuisine to make their selections.  There were Entrees, A La Carte and Combo meals available.  Jamski's Entrees were mostly served with Rice, Peas & Fried Plantains.  Entrees included items like Seafood Rundun (RunDown), Escoveitch Fish, Ackee & Salt, Brown Stew, Jerk Roasted Fish, Curry Chicken/Pork/Goat, Salt Fish with Broad Beans/Cabbage, Brown Stew Chicken, Roast Beef, Steamed Fish, Jerk Pork, Roast Beef, my all time favorite- Brown Stew Oxtail and Jerk Chicken of course.  For the entrees that aren't served with Rice, Peas & Plantain, you get Steamed Vegetables, Boiled Green Banana & Bolied Yam. 

For the A La Carte Menu, items included Curry Vegetables & Beans Delight, Curry Snails, Curry Prawns, Curry Goat Wrap, Chicken/Fish Soup, Jamski BBQ Wings, Jamski Chicken Wrap,Jamski One Pot, Jamski Fried Rice, Jamski Chicken Wings, Red Peas Soup, Prawns & Chicken Stir-Fry, Roast Beef, Seafood Rundown, Pumpkin Soup, Popcorn Chicken, Jamski Alfredo Pasta, Goat Soup (spicy mannish wata), plus the usual 'classics' like Jerk Pork, Roasted Fish, Roasted Curry Oxtail, Curry Jerk Chicken, Curry Goat, Escoveitch Fish, Brown Stew Chicken and Ackee Salt. The Combo Meals at Jamski are Beef Patty & Coco Bread, Callalo Loaf with Sweet Potatoes Wedges, Popcorn Chicken & Tallawah Bites, Meat Loaf with Sweet Potato Wedges, Jerk Chicken & Sweet Potato Wedges, Jerk Chicken Loaf, Salt Fish Loaf & Pieces of Jerk Chicken, Cheese Patties & Coco Bread, Callaloo Loaf, Jerk Chicken & Coleslaw, Jerk BBQ Wings, Festival (sweetened fried dough) & Sweet Potato Wedges, Jerk Chicken, Festival with Coleslaw, Meat Loaf with Jerk Chicken, Jerk Pork, Festival with Coleslaw, Brown Stew Oxtail and Brown Stew Chicken, Festival, Fried Ripe Plantain & Coleslaw.  Side Dishes include Salt Fish Fritters, Steamed Veggies, Festival, Sweet Potato Wedges, Mac & Cheese and Plantains. 

They had a colorful fridgeful of home-made alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.  This variety of 'elixirs' were mostly laced with one of Jamaica's most well-known exploits- Rum! Of course, Rum Punch, as well as other cocktail-like offerings in plastic bottles were available.  Mixed Fruit, Pina Colada, Lemon/Ginger, Sorrel and other non-alcoholic mix-ups were also on offer.  There was also a shelf stocked full of house-made jerk sauces and marinades.  I ordered the Jerk Chicken and Brown Stew Oxtail Entrees, plus a Mixed Fruit Mocktail to go, as I was in s hurry.  Just as I expected, everything tasted incredible; cooked  with Princess's love, heart and soul! Ô£ø√º√≤√£ The chicken was spicy and flavorful, and the oxtail was smooth and melts-in-your-mouth velvety!  It tasted truly authentic, and brought back so many fun memories of my University days in Southern Florida, where I grew to love this enduring Caribbean cuisine.  Wish I got to have the Jamaican Patty, but there just wasn't enough time to grill them. 

So in conclusion, I cannot say enough nice and positive things about Jamski.  This place is a resplendent and wholesome joint!  I don't know why the song by Jimmy Cliff, 'Wonderful World, Beautiful People' kept reverberating in my head for some reason! Ô£ø√º¬ß√Æ I hope this isn't an offensive cliche or inappropriate stereotype; however, these are the words that seemed to 'rotate' in my head and mind in regards to PAPA JAMSKI and PRINCESS who are just that-.....Wonderful People....! in their 'Wonderful World'! Ô£ø√º√≤√ë  It was fascinating to me to see Papa Jamski sitting down to write a new menu for the restaurant.  I thought to myself, 'what else could he possibly add to this vast, diverse and expansive menu?' 'what more delectable Island treats could he additionally include?'.  Since I definitely plan on returning to Jamski, by the special grace of Almighty God, it would be interesting to see what additions he'll make!  Wish him the best of luck there. Ô£ø√º√´√ßÔ£ø√º√®Œ©  I look forward to dining in next time.  My overall experience at Jamski was fantabulous; from the delicious food, to the warm ambiance to my jolly interactions.  The only frank criticism I would impart on Jamski is that the fried plantain was cut too thin.  It seemed more like soft plantain chips, so I would kindly urge them to slice their plantains a little more thickly please.  I want to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to PAPA JAMSKI and PRINCESS 'JAMSKI', (as I fondly named her!). Ô£ø√º¬ß√≥  Their down-to-earth candour, friendly demeanor and pure professionalism is unparalleled and they should be extremely proud of their impressive establishment!  I loved coming here, and Iook forward to returning in the not-too-distant future to sample as much as their awesome options as possible. YEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH MAN!!!

3483,Y6571FYandyc,It's As Laid Back as Jamaica!!,"This is not fine dining. It's a few tables with Jamaican placemats, murals of Bob Marley on the wall and no two glasses the same!! The service is not the quickest and the food won't necessarily arrive all at the same time.

But you know...what? It doesn't matter (unless you're an obsessive compulsive). It's Jamaican!! You will get a warm welcome from Emmanual and his wife knows how to turn out very tasty Jamaican food. Most of my friends are fans of their signature patties - me less so. But I have tried most of the menu over a period of months. The Brown Stew Oxtail (like all the brown stew dishes) is meaty and thick with a sticky barbecue sauce. The Jerk Chicken is great but my favourite is the Jamski One Pot where you get a little bit of everything and its served with rice and peas and some plantain.

You can bet that the background music will be reggae (what else would you expect). And I can recommend the Jamaican Rum Punch (which is what it packs!) or for non-alcohol drinkers a Banana punch.

If you looking for fine dining or regimented service delivery this may not be for you. If you want a fun, chilled out evening, some good food and the chance to relax I highly recommend Jamski.More",5.0,2019-04-01,4.5,Jamski

3645,Francis N,Good old fashion authentic burger,"I went on 2 consecutive evenings over Christmas with family. The ambience is welcoming, though the dimmed lighting made reading the menu somewhat challenging (silly me forgot her glassesÔ£ø√º√¥√†). 
On the first day, I had a bacon single cheeseburger with cheesy fries. I could barely...taste the bacon, the actual burger patty was dry and tasted somewhat gamey, almost like it was made from goat meat... one of my fellow diners thought so too. The onions were raw rather than caramelised and the bread seemed a bit doughy. I ended up with indigestion and mild heartburn, and kept belching up a foul oily aftertaste... overall, I would not recommend this burger nor would I try it again. The saving grace was the cheesy fries which was really cheesy and soOoo yummy, I would order them again and the serving portion was generous too.
Sucker for punishment that I am, or maybe in the spirit of Christmas and keeping an open mind, I returned the next night as the children in the group insisted on Johnny Rockets. I knew I was going to have the cheesy chips for sure, but decided to try the Chicken club sandwich on wheat bread this time. The bread tasted stale and the salad in the sandwich was underdressed, the chicken was dry and stringy. As a personal choice, because I find it easier to manoeuvre, I prefer my sandwich cut into 4 and preferably without the crust. I did not enjoy this club sandwich. I had a coffee  milkshake which was full of flavour, rich, creamy and very moreish. I asked to speak to a manager,but was told there wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t one on site. I mentioned my concerns  to our server but he wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t particularly helpful, although, I guess if that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the usual fare and no one else has mentioned these  and people like me despite the complaints keep coming back, then there‚Äö√Ñ√¥s no reason for him to be concerned.More",1.0,2018-10-01,4.0,Johnny Rockets

It has outdoor and indoor sitting areas, the outdoor section is on the rooftop. The food tasted awesome...and the cocktail wasn't bad at all (just needed a bit more alcohol). Their menu items arent too pricey and the service time (food preparation) was impressive. Some of the menu items however were unavailable and it also took some time before we were attended to (after waiting about 10 minutesto no avail, I had to go downstairsto the bar and ask for a waiter to come take our order) - hence the 4 star rating instead of 5.

The staff were well dressed, warm hearted, engaging and enthusiastic about service delivery. They probed and suggested meal options until they got all of us smiling. I looked across intermittently and all other guests were equally smiling and chatty.

4337,NaijaBabe2016,Truly Authentic Italian Cuisine!  Ô£ø√º√ü√ú Ô£ø√º√ß¬ß Ô£ø√º√ß√π Ô£ø√º√ß√Ø,"La Veranda Italian Cuisine/Restaurant is part of the leisure and hospitality entity known as The Blowfish Group. This comprises of a hotel- The Blowfish Hotel, 9-7 Supermarket and about 5/6 Restaurants. The Restaurants include: Izanagi Japanese Restaurant, Woks Asian Cuisine, Seabass Seafood Restaurant, Velvett Grill...Lounge & Bar, Mahawis Lebanese Grill and of course- La Veranda Italian Cuisine. A Purple Restaurant was also listed, but don't know if it's still operational, or the name changed. La Veranda and Woks Asian are located inside The Blowfish Hotel, while the others are situated in and around the same street. There's also 'The Poolside by Blowfish'- a casual/sports bar type eatery by the hotel pool. I had the pleasure of dining at Izanagi Japanese Restaurant a few years back; (you can read my separate review of it on TripAdvisor). 

Even though I knew The Blowfish Group had a number of restaurants, I had no idea an Italian Restaurant was a part of them. On this visit to Lagos, I was with 2 of my daughters who happen to love Italian food, so a google search of Italian Cuisine on Lagos Island brought us to La Veranda. The restaurant is located above/opposite the pool area, just by an adorable children's playground surrounded by lush greenery. You access it via a staircase. The restaurant was lovely, with an elevated, breathtaking, 'deep blue' backdrop of Blowfish Hotel's swimming pool. Service was fast and efficient, but our main criticism was that we were not informed that there was a non-smoking seating area. We ended up sitting in the smoking area and got simultaneously bombarded by the second hand cigarette and shisha smoke of two different sets of customers. Had we known this, we would have asked to be seated in the non-smoking section of La Veranda. They had outdoor, as well as indoor seating.

La Veranda Italian Cuisine has an awesome menu featuring numerous Italian Classics. It comprised of 14 ANTIPASTI, 9 SALADS, 2 SOUPS, 20 PASTAS, 6 STEAKS, 8 MAIN COURSES, 3 PIATTI DELLA CASA (HOUSE DISHES), 12 CLASSIC PIZZAS, 3 VEGETARIAN PIZZAS, 3 WHITE PIZZAS, 2 SIDE DISHES, 6 DESSERTS, 3 MILKSHAKES, FRESH JUICES, COFFEE & TEA, 4 MOCKTAILS, SPECIALTY SHOTS, COCKTAILS, and a heck of a lot of ALCOHOL, plus a sizeable SHISHA selection. 

We were a party of 3, so for our Starters, we ordered the ARANCINI (a rustic, Italian favorite, crispy bites of risotto, breaded mozzarella cheese, served with creamy balsamic sauce for dipping), SHRIMP SCAMPI FRITTA (hand-breaded & fried shrimp lightly tossed with garlic & a butter lemon sauce) and BASTONCINI DI MOZZARELLA (MOZZARELLA SQUARES). We also ordered a Classic Pizza- the FRUTTI DI MARE (tomato, mozzarella, shrimps, calamari, garlic, chilli). For our Mains, we ordered the PENNE AL PESTO (penne pasta tossed with homemade basil pesto sauce), a TAGLIATELLE CON POLLO (thinly sliced chicken breast, sauteed mushrooms in a fresh cream sauce, over a bed of pasta ribbons) and the RAVIOLI DE LA CASA (homemade fresh ravioli filled with ricotta & spinach, prepared with a mushroom, creamy rosa sauce). 

For our drinks, we got 2 Mocktails, the BERRY GO ROUND (raspberry, mint) and VERANDA PASSION (passionfruit, strawberry, orange), and one VANILLA MILKSHAKE. We got a takeaway order for our driver. It was, the SPHAGHETTI ALLA BOLOGNESE (sphaghetti topped with a hearty tomato meat sauce & fresh basil) and a MIXED GREEN SALAD (mixed lettuce tossed in our signature lemon vinaigrette with tomatoes, green pepper, cucumber & olives). The Starters were good, but for the Arancini, I expected the creamy balsamic glaze to come as a side dipping sauce, as opposed to being drizzled on the Arancini. It had an unappealing color that looked like a caramel sauce. I also thought that the Shrimp Scampi would be a tad bit more fried than it was. The Mozzarella Squares were imcredible. 

The Seafood Pizza was delicious, however, the pizza crust/base was a little on the thin side and there wasn't enough calamari on it. My Ravioli was amazing- so smooth and creamy, but the portion was on the small side. My daughter didn't like her Vanilla Milkshake. She found it to be too sweet and quite grainy with tiny pellets of ice in it. They both really enjoyed their Tagliatelle and Penne Pesto. The Mocktails were very good- fruity and refreshing. Our dining experience at La Veranda Italian Cuisine was overall, a rather pleasant one. As previously mentioned, the main 'hiccup' we had was other diners blowing smoke in our direction, and that was very unfortunate and super annoying. None of the staffers wore name tags, so I can't identify them in this review, but the service at La Veranda was generally quite impressive. The food is without a doubt truly authentic Italian Cuisine! Ô£ø√º√´√•Ô£ø√º√®Œ© Even though Italian Food doesn't quite make my list of 'Top Ten Favorite Cuisines' in the world, I look forward to visiting La Veranda Restaurant again; sometime in the near future!

4445,Leosquests,My New Go to Spot...,"Lydia's Place is a nice cosy restaurant which caters local Nigeria dishes from Rice, Pasta, a range of soups and staple,etc. They also have private lounges.
The first time i ate here, i ordered the Seafood Okro with Poundo Yam, and i was sold! It...was soo nice and even though i was filled up i had to request a take home pack! yes it was that good.
Great value for money as the portions are large, reasonably priced and service is pleasant,

Down side is the wait period; it took so long....  so be prepared to wait awhile, although i discovered you can make a call to place your order befor your arrival and this cuts the wait time almost by half. Also parking can be abit of an issue especially Friday evenings (but then again so is almost every hangout spot in Lagos) so you may have to park outside and pay a tip.

It took an hour plus to get the food out and the waitress was not too friendly and never smiled. Anyway...the scam here was that I got Edikaikong soup instead of Editan which I ordered and my friend got Editan when she ordered Afang. Chika didn't know the difference but I did because I'm from Akwa Ibom and very familiar with our native soups. I didn't bother to have it corrected coz that would have been another 1 hour wait.More,5.0,2016-07-01,4.0,Lydia's Place Restaurant and Lounge

4456,Y6571FYandyc,For Nigerian Food Lovers A Real Treat!,"Tucked away in Victoria Island lies Lydia's Place. It's a nice and well thought out space. Downstairs it looks like a traditional restaurant while upstairs are the lounges including private rooms. The menu is typically Nigerian - a wide range of 'soups' including Egusi, Okro,...Banga and Oha to name but a few along with rice dishes and the predictable range of additions such as beef, chicken, goat meat, snail, seafood and fish. In passing, in a country which typically overlooks beef to ridiculous extremes, it is a plus that Lydia's produce beef far more palatable to a European palate. The food is cooked fresh and there are positives and negatives attached to this. The positives include the diner being able to regulate the heat of the spices - my friend likes ""mild"" while I prefer ""hot hot""! It also ensures a good quality to the final product. The downside however is that you can expect to wait 45-60 minutes for your food (but it's worth waiting for). My tip is on the first visit get a take away menu and then on subsequent trips phone your order through 30 minutes before you arrive and then your food will be with you giving you enough time to first enjoy a drink. The staff are friendly and attentive and the value for money is good - you can expect to pay around N3,500 (¬¨¬£14 or $22) per head for portions large enough to eat half and take the rest home. Be warned that there is the occasional karaoke night which attracts volunteers of varying talent. My one main criticism is that they need to sort out the water and drying facilities in the rest room. Overall a positive experience if you like Nigerian food.More",3.0,2013-10-01,4.0,Lydia's Place Restaurant and Lounge

Their prices are quite steep I must say. Their food was good though their dumpling wrap was a bit doughy. Not the clear white and thin texture you get from Chopsticks Chinese Restaurant (Ikeja) or Jade's Palace (V/I). I was surprised to see how busy it was that Sunday afternoon considering that the restaurant is located at the basement and the sign outside the building is almost invincible. Service was courteous too. A big minus for me: I was served the ordinary rice instead of the basmati variety Chinese restaurants use and it wasn't even salted. I expected to get more salted flavoring from the fish sauce but it seems the restaurant is afraid of salting their food. For such a steep price I expected better. The only meal I enjoyed was the seafood soup. A good enough place to take your family or friends to if you've got the money to burn.More",5.0,2017-02-01,4.0,New China Restaurant

4546,JusticeJoyce,Ambience & Vibe = Adult but some Entrees are Lacking,"Great service. 
Food just average. 
I'd recommend Fresh Cut fries anytime. 
Beef Bourguignon - beef wasn't sliced as thick as I anticipated but not suya street meat thin. It's served separate from the mashed potatoes. Included zucchini, carrot and just a touch of onions. The...sauce could have been more robust with flavor. Even the French cook with my more spices/seasoning/flavor. 

Lobster Thermidor - forever grateful they do not use egg. The rice pilaf that's served alongside is as bland and flavorless as possible. You'll do best rolling the thermidor amongst the rice so the cream rolls into the rice. A half portion was sufficient, but I'd totally recommend the full serving should you have time/money/room. 

Chicken Sandwich (Burger) - this was chosen as grilled over battered. We had a lot of carbs so there's that. The fries were crisp and seasoned as they should be but you rarely find in these parts. Topped with lettuce. Mayo spread. Tomato slices. Fried onions that were cold against everything else. Recommend with a notice to watch for the toppings condiments if you have allergens.

Truffle Pasta with homemade fettuccine - I was asked and opted for the homemade pasta. I probably should have went with the store bought. The Parmesan cheese topping is authentic but the truffles were hard to find and Taste yet the butter was prominently evident. Given all the dishes and the lack of flavor begging for immediate consumption - I had it packed to go home via takeaway. 

By the way they charge for ToGo containers. Take away. At these prices it should be included. 

Service was attentive. 
Saturday night had 4 tables total and the service didn't fail. 
The welcoming bread basket was served via a paper napkin in the bowl. Given these prices and location - I'd expect a cloth napkin at best. They have monogrammed cloth napkins at different seats in the restaurant. 
Vibe - good for a date night or group or family. Took the window view and sat in the booth. Lighting was apropos for the mood.  

I shall return for salads, soup and fried shrimp. Plus, I know I'd like to try 1 dessert eventually but no rush to drop 40-60k.

4547,Ayo O,Fine Dinning in Fine Portions,"Noir boasts of fair parking space- that is important when you choose to dine out on a weekend evening in Lagos.

 Climb up to the restaurant on the first floor and the interior welcomes you with brilliant Nigerian paintings that adorn its walls and a...full length window that gives a view of the street outside. House Music remixes of popular contemporary songs played in the background . Each table has a hand sanitizer for guests and the restroom is neat.

The waiters are attentive and their adaptability quite commendable.
However, the food..., yes, the food. 
For a glass of tropical cocktail juice at Noir, I expect hand-squeezed fresh fruits and not the obvious mix of supermarket packed juices.

The seafood salad arrives and looks colourful but the chef is miserly with the shrimps. I can make out the three pieces tucked beneath the lush greenery.
I compare this same meal I had ordered at another restaurant within the neighbourhood and certainly the chef here is quite restrained in his/her portions.

Apparently the prices on the menu didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t match what they were charged on their receipts and I and my partner could hear everything going on. Secondly, the Visa menu didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t state that the mains come without sides so we had to order sides with our mains at extra cost. Thirdly, we were given very hard butter with our bread basket and we had to send the butter back twice just so we could be given spreadable butter. The wine selection was good though and we really enjoyed the red wine we had with our meal. During our meal, the restaurant manager came up to ask for feedback and we mentioned the hard butter and the sides not coming with our mains and as a goodwill gesture, she made our sides complimentary.

They didn't have the wine I wanted ( this actually is typical) I did ask the waiter if they had all the wines on the...wine list! I asked to see 2 French wines and he brought 1 Spanish and French!!! 

The bread they brought was a let down. We were actually shocked at the quality + we asked for warm bread, it came cold! They warmed it when we returned it. 

We enjoyed our starters, my foie gras was nice enough and my wife enjoyed salmon. Although presentation can be improved upon. 

We had steak cooked at our table, nice experience however I expected a little bit more flair... we enjoyed the meat.
The dessert was nice and we had no complaints.  

We both agreed customer service has serious room for improvement,  no greetings (from supervisory staff and several waiters) the waiter who brought our cold bread looked like he was being forced to do the task, dropped the bread without a single greeting,  spilled oil on the table, didn't acknowledge or apologize and just walked away. 

I gave some feedback to Festus (one of the waiters who looked like a supervisor) about equipping waiters with adequate information before sending them off to interface with guests. 

It is not a cheap place and as such I expected a little bit more in terms of service.  This was our first time and we agreed we would most likely not return.

Dined outdoors. 
Had to flag down a server. Later learned he was the manager or someone of authority. 
They didn't have the lobster entree. 
Ordered Shrimp Yaji. Oxtail. Jollof. Plantain Beignets. Salad. Water as the drinks were not where...I wanted to spend my money given all the food I was happy to try. 

Salad actually came with a dressing that was not mayo based as it seems to be the standard here. 

They grill live as we sat too close and the smokey grill can reach you at some point. 

Cute ambience for the patio/outdoor space. You'll want the fans going to keep mosquitoes away but I always forget smokers exist around here. Le sigh. 

After dining at the table we sat in the cute lounge area and the furniture is adorable. So much so, I took pictures to get replicas. 

Jerk chicken was appropriately spiced. 
Shrimps are not popcorn but nothing large. They are battered and the sauce was good. Has a tang of sweet and bitter with spice. I miss fried shrimp so much that I would have ordered 2 servings if I didn't already start the smorgasbord. 

Check my pictures for costs, plating and know they'll be busy at night so be prepared to wait for service or write out your entire order as I did to help move things along. Pacing for food delivery was better than the average competitor in the area but a tad delayed at this price point.

The food was horrible - the ‚Äö√Ñ√ªlobster‚Äö√Ñ√∫ wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t a lobster, the meat was chewy and old, the sauce had a disgustingly tingy stench, the chicken was dry and sad. But that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not the reason...why I am writing this review. The reason is theft. After we had our horrible meal - again I cannot stress this enough, three out of two main dishes were proper disgusting, one was okayish and the starters were an insolence - we paid with our credit card. The bill was 200 USD for four people, we split and paid 100 USD for two. I gave the waiter (who was nice, but very badly trained) my credit card. He swiped and told me it hadn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t gone through and that we had to do it again. I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t mind. I wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t surprised that the POS didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t work properly in this restaurant. The waiter swiped again. This time, he told us, everything was fine. When I checked my credit card statement the next day, it showed that NOK had double booked my card. Turns out it did work the first time, the waiter just decided to take money from my card twice. I contacted the restaurant and explained the issue to the manager. I though ‚Äö√Ñ√≤hey your food might be disgusting and your entire menu a pretentious overprice joke, but that doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t mean that you would steal from me.‚Äö√Ñ√≤ Turns out I was wrong. Not only did the manager react in a very unfriendly manner when I told him his waiter had stolen 100 USD from my card, until this day, NOK has not given back the money they stole from me. I have written them dozens of WhatsApp messages, I have given them my banking details, I have sent them a copy of my credit card statement - and still: nothing. NOK‚Äö√Ñ√¥s so-called manager even admitted that they had stolen my money - he asked his bank and they confirmed that they had taken double the amount I was supposed to pay from my card - but that didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t lead to them transferring me my money back, let alone apologize for their grave mistake. I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know what to do anymore. I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t live in Lagos - otherwise I would have called the police by now. I am back in Europe and this restaurant stole from me.

4663,NaijaBabe2016,Disappointing Sushi! Ô£ø√º√ß¬£Ô£ø√º√´√©Ô£ø√º√®Œ©,"This is my second visit to Ocean Basket- (the V.I Akin Adesola branch). Was with my daughter this time around, so decided to try it again because she loves Seafood, and Ocean Basket is your one-stop-shop for great Seafood in Lagos. I won't get into...any details about the restaurant/menu, as I wrote an extensive review about it 5 months ago. It was an overall pleasant experience, with yummy Seafood and a nice ambiance. I wanted to try the Sushi at Ocean Basket on my maiden visit, but was told at mid-day that it wouldn't be available till after 3p.m, so I had to settle for their regular Seafood options.

This time around, Sushi was available, (thank heavens)! Ô£ø√º¬ß‚â§Ô£ø√º√®Œ© Not being too hungry, I ordered just 2 Sushi(s)- the PANKO SALMON FUTOMAKI and the PANKO PRAWN FLOWER GUNKANS, plus CRUMBED PRAWN TAILS (Served with Herb Mayonnaise) as my Starter. My daughter got the LEMON GARLIC MUSSELS or MUSSELS IN LEMON GARLIC SAUCE and CREAMY SEAFOOD PASTA. For her drink, she got a Mocktail called OCEAN BASKET SPECIAL. We were presented with 3 complimentary freshly baked Bread Rolls, served with 3 'mismatched' Sauces/Dips. The last time around, these Bread Rolls weren't fresh, but on this visit, they were hot, soft and fluffy! Ô£ø√º√≤√£

Both my Sushi(s) were a big letdown! First of all, the rice used wasn't the right kind, and just about every ingredient within the Sushi was tasteless and underseasoned. For the Flower Gunkans, I thought the actual Sushi would be wrapped in a sheet of Smoked Salmon. Yet, it was enveloped in a murky, pale, overly thick slice of pickled ginger! YUCK! Ô£ø√º√≤¬¥ It was too thick and pungent to be eaten, so I ended up unwrapping the ginger and discarding it entirely. The Futomaki Panko Salmon was decent, but perhaps because it was deep fried. Nevertheless, it lacked flavor. My Crumbed Prawn Tails were good, so crunchy, fleshy and fried perfectly. 

My daughter loved, loved, loved her Creamy Seafood Pasta. She said it's one of the best Pasta dishes she's ever had, and that they were super generous with the Seafood in it. For over 10 thousand naira....they better be! Ô£ø√º√≤√ë She also enjoyed her Ocean Basket Special Mocktail, but as for the Lemon Garlic Mussels, it was a different story. Though she said the sauce was delicious, the Mussels weren't cleaned properly, so the 'waste product' on them was still attached to the flesh. How gross! Ô£ø√º¬ß√Ü Not knowing much about this type of shellfish, (as I don't like it)- I took her word for it. 

So this second experience at Ocean Basket ends up being a 'mixed bag'......a medicore mixed bag at best! Service is okay, albeit a bit slow. We had to urge them to speed it up a bit as we were in a hurry. Ocean Basket is still a place a would visit again, but I will most definitely avoid their Sushi. It is crystal clear that SUSHI IS NOT THEIR STRENGTH, so I'd politely urge customers visiting Ocean Basket to kindly avoid the Sushi here and go for the various types of Seafood on offer. Sending their employees to Sushi School won't hurt! Ô£ø√º√ß¬£ Ô£ø√º√ß¬± Ô£ø√º√®¬¢

I rated Ocean Basket highly the first time I reviewed them, but this time around, it's going to have to be an average. The only thing that 'salvaged' the experience was the Fresh Bread, Crumbed Prawn Tails, the Lemon Garlic Sauce that accompanied the Mussels, and the Creamy Seafood Pasta of course. They should please endeavor to improve upon their Sushi, clean out the poop from their Mussels and speed up the service a tad bit. Regardless of the 'hiccups' this time around, Ocean Basket is still a wholesome, decent Seafood Joint that serves impressive Seafood, and I'd highly recommend it!

4664,NaijaBabe2016,Impressive Seafood! Ô£ø√º√ß¬ß Ô£ø√º¬∂√Ñ Ô£ø√º√™√º Ô£ø√º¬∂√™,"I've been wanting to eat at Ocean Basket restaurant since I caught a glimpse of it while on a brief visit to Lagos last year. See I love, love, love me some seafood! Ô£ø√º¬∂√™Ô£ø√º√™√º Ô£ø√º¬∂√Ñ Ô£ø√º√≤√£ Besides, 'jewels of the sea & ocean' are few...and far between in a country like Nigeria; except if you happen to be in a port city like as Lagos. If I'm not mistaken, Ocean Basket is a South African chain of restaurants- with multiple branches in Africa, a few in Europe and one in the Middle East. I visited one of 3 branches in Lagos- (the Victoria Island one), and the restaurant was expansive, simple, bright and trendy. It was spread over 2 floors, plus a small outdoor/balcony area. Unfortunately they had a water leakage problem from the ceiling of the second floor on the day I visited, so I was seated in sort of a private room area upstairs. I had to bolt out of there fast because there was a French speaking family with small children that were super loud without consideration for anybody. Seriously, they seemed to be engaged in a shouting match! Ô£ø√º√¥√¢ I simply couldn't bear to sit there, so I was subsequently ushered downstairs. These folks were causing one hell of a commotion!!! Ô£ø√º√≤¬¥

Ocean Basket's menu is plentiful, without being too overwhelming. They had Starters & Meze, Salads, Platters (for one and to share), Fish, Prawns, Calamari, A Mediterranean Dish (Fritto Misto), Combos, Seafood Favorites, Ocean Basket Specials, Top Ups (sides), Sushi (plus Sushi Platters), Desserts (including Liquid Desserts) Mocktail Carafes, Beers, Ciders, Cold Coolers, Coffees/Teas and Cold Drinks. I wanted to order a Platter For One and Flower Gunkans Sushi , but was told that Sushi wouldn't be available till after 3p.m. I visited around noon. How disappointing that was, as their Sushi looked good from the pictures on the menu! Ô£ø√º√ß¬£ Ô£ø√º√≤√£ Instead, I went for the NEPTUNE MEZE PLATTER (hake goujons, firecracker squid, calamari, crumbed prawn tails, battered zucchini, tomato, cucumber with 1,000 island, herb mayo and zesty mayo) from the Starters & Meze section. I also ordered an additional FAMOUS FISH & FISH (200gs of the all time favorite hake) cause I was famished. This meal would serve as my breakfast, lunch and dinner, as I was set to travel later that day. For my drink, I got the OCEAN BASKET SPECIAL, one of the mocktails on offer. For dessert, I ordered a CUSTARD TART (Past‚àö¬©is De Nata)- a Portuguese Custard Tartlet. 

Overall, I have to say that I really enjoyed both my Neptune Meze Platter and the Fish & Chips. Both dishes were fried to crispy, golden perfection and presented impeccably; (refer to my posted pictures). The mocktail was very good too, as was the Custard Tart. However, the 'Pasteis De Nata' seemed to have fallen apart by the time it reached my table, so it looked a bit 'deconstructed'. Besides, it didn't taste fresh. I was served a complimentary bread basket with 3 weird dips, and 'unfresh' bread that had been over-warmed to the point of becoming as hard as a rock! Wish they had just passed on this. Service at Ocean Basket is excellent, from the friendly and polite demeanor of all the staff, to the Manager's warm reception. There was someone named WALE, (either the waiter who served me, or the Manager), can't quite seem to remember. I'd like to thank him for his kindness. The food was promptly delivered, and just about everything was on point. The ambiance of Ocean Basket is 'cool, calm & collected', and everything seems clean, orderly and well maintained.

 I was slightly let down by the fact that they couldn't 'tame' the boisterously loud family in the enclosed seating area I had initially sat down at. I wasn't the only guest who asked to leave that particular area. They were at least 2 sets of customers that came downstairs complaining about the ruckus they were causing! Ô£ø√º√≤¬¥ When I lamented about the noise, all they said was that they couldn't tell the family to keep it down because there was a language barrier, since they only spoke French! This is unacceptable, and came across as a weak, pathetic excuse not to keep rowdy customers in line. They need to take all their customer's 'feelings' into consideration, and not just one set of 'Francophone Loud-Mouths'! So all in all, I enjoyed my experience at Ocean Basket. This indeed is the 'Mediterranean Home of Seafood'- (just like it says under the title). The seafood is delicious, and I really look forward to returning and sampling many other dishes, especially their Sushi. It's your 'go-to-place' for fabulous Seafood in Lagos, and I highly, highly recommend it!!!

5010,omohunola,Local vibe,"It was a random day in July,I was out with friends to celebrate someone‚Äö√Ñ√¥s birthday,it was all our first times and we were unsure of the location so we ordered an Uber.We were dropped off randomly on the street and we literally passed the entrance...5 times before realizing we were there
Fast forward to when we got inside,beautiful scenery although a lot smaller than what it appeared to be like in pictures 
We had two choices ;eat inside or the outdoor area,it was a rainy day so we sat inside guided to out seats by a lovely waiter in this cute Yoruba ish get up
We ordered the regular,the ofada rice,it came with a side of plaintain and the whole dish in its entirety was simply lovely and I must say delicious,unfortunately I do not have any pictures of the food 
In conclusion,I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d be visiting again real soon,the only downside to it is the building is not all that noticeable and relatively small. The staff were really nice and polite and customer service was on point,the food was affordable for a price of 1500 ,they had lovely looking cocktails though I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t try any
It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a wonderful location for a serene meeting for lovers and a cool hang out place for friends and trust me your pictures are going to be the bombMore",5.0,2019-10-01,4.0,Ofadaboy

We ended up paying for the meal that we didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t eat so as to not escalate the issue and calmly approached her to discuss better ways this situation could have been handled since absolutely no customer service skills were exercised. Instead of engaging in this conversation, the manager / owner raised her voice and yelled at us to leave, saying we got what we ordered.

They forcefully make us to take that food but we asked them remove without even having 1/4 portion. Actually the disappointment part is customer service is very poor. 

We asked for manager but supervisor came to our table listen to our complaint and walk back, no apologies at least it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a curtosey to react for customers complain. This is we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re loosing customers very easily.

It's not a place you'd take the family. But that applies to most...bars I've been to in West Africa. The service is good, the food has never made me or any of my colleagues ill and the pizzas are really not bad at all. The outside area is pleasant enough, but inside can be a bit noisy. Crucially, the drinks are cold, although you tend to have to emphasise the point if you want a really cold beer.

The friendly female clientele aren't too annoying. If you want a quiet evening on your own to have a drink and something to eat, the best strategy is to buy whoever sits next to you a drink, make it clear that you're not interested and then let her sit there and keep the others away. 

When leaving it's best to make sure your Uber or driver are waiting right outside before you walk out. That way you can avoid the hawkers and the attentions of the ladies who haven't been allowed in or have been chucked out.More",3.5,2020-01-01,3.5,Pats Bar

5202,NaijaBabe2016,Authentic Chinese Cuisine @ its finest!!! Ô£ø√º‚Ä¢√º Ô£ø√º√ß√µ Ô£ø√º√ß‚â§,"This was either my third of fourth visit to Pearl Garden Restaurant. And even though I can't quite seem to remember how many times I dined at this fabulous restaurant, I do however recall how incredible their food was! Pearl Garden touts itself as one...of the best Chinese restaurants in Lagos, specializing in authentic oriental cuisine. It's a local favorite; extremely popular with Lagosians and expatriates as well, plus one of the number one go-to places for corporate events, wedding parties and numerous large gatherings/functions. This is unsurprising, being that Pearl Garden has a humungous 'surface area'. The restaurant is vast and expansive, with plenty of space, seating, not to mention the fact that it's a two story building. The decor is 100% oriental; with golden, ornate and intricate designs, fittings, trimmings and accoutrements. There's a big focus on the colour red, which gives it a warm and rich vibe. It's like you've been transported to Asia when you step into this magnificent restaurant! And then there's the food! Ô£ø√º√≤√£ Pearl Garden serves up some of the best Chinese food I have ever had the pleasure of eating in Nigeria; so authentic and sinfully delicious. It also has a very convenient location; on a quiet street in the heart of Victoria Island. Service is also top notch at Pearl Garden. From the moment you walk in, to the time you leave, everyone- from the staff to the Chefs to the waiters is friendly, respectful, professional and diligent. 

We ordered DEEP FRIED PRAWN CUTLET, PRAWN SPRING ROLLS WITH MAYONNAISE as our starters. For the mains, we got SHREDDED BEEF WITH GREEN PEPPER, PRAWNS IN SWEET & SOUR SAUCE and FRIED RICE WITH SEAFOOD. For my drink, I got the PUNCH D'SPECIAL. This is a mocktail made with a mix of orange juice, red grape juice, lemon squash and grenadine. As was to be expected, everything tasted absolutely delicious, especially the Prawn Sweet & Sour, which is an all-time favourite of mine. The sauce was sweet, tangy, sticky and velvety- just how I like my S'n'S sauces! Ô£ø√º√≤√£ The Fried Rice was cooked to perfection, with generous amounts of various seafood chunks. The Shredded Beef was packed with so much 'soy-saucy' flavour, and the crunch of the green peppers and onions added to the dish's goodness. The Prawn Spring Rolls were fried to a golden brown, lovely colour and were so sumptuous, as were the enormous Prawn Cutlets. I also enjoyed the Punch D'Special mocktail. It was a tad bit sweet, a tad bit bitter, and a tad bit tart, yet very refreshing. 

Pearl Garden Restaurant is definitely a place worth visiting if ever your in the mood for an eatery that specializes in authentic Chinese cuisine. There isn't a single thing I would change about this restaurant, however, I would like to see a complimentary treat provided to customers, either before or after your meal, which is commonly customary in many Chinese restaurants. It just seems appropriate for a restaurant of this class and calibre. For example, a bowl of Prawn Crackers as you wait for your order, or some Fortune Cookies or freshly cut oranges with cherries after you finish eating would be nice. Hope this isn't a stereotype and won't be open to a negative interpretation! Ô£ø√º√≤√ò But I would also expect complimentary Nachos at a Mexican Restaurant or complimentary Bread Rolls at an Italian or French Restaurant or Raita/Chutneys/Dips at an Indian Restaurant. Didn't catch the name of the waiter who served us, but I'd like to say thank you to him for advising us not to order an additional dish because he said it would be too much food for us. He was right! Ô£ø√º√≤√ÖWe could barely finish the dishes we ordered. Their portions are quite big here. Pearl Garden Restaurant stands as a testament to truly authentic Chinese fare that is one of the best places you will have the pleasure of dining at in Lagos. This place exudes finesse, class, grace, professionalism and of course, phenomenally great Chinese food. I will continue to return to Pearl Garden Restaurant because it is a paragon of excellence and the 'gold standard' for original, truly authentic Chinese Cuisine. Nobody does Chinese food better than these guys! Keep up the great job Pearl Garden! Ô£ø√º√´√®Ô£ø√º√®Œ© Highly, highly, highly recommended!!!

5207,johne999a,Not impressed,"Used to eat here a lot, when it was smaller and across the road. Now they seem to have totally lost the plot about what is good food and good service. Get past the stupendous price (even for Lagos) for example $20 for a small...bowl of rice, the food was very average. We order pork ribs for our 8 yo, the menu stated with spicy sauce, so we asked the sauce to be on the side... they charged extra for this. The ribs we ordered (salt and pepper, used to be delicious), came as virtually inedible rubbery lumps of meat. Only the dumplings were of a reasonable standard. 

The wine options are limited with cheap to average wine sold for expensive to insane prices (20k Naira for a wine I pay elsewhere 6k), then they added 20% service charge. The real kicker was when we come to pay, swiped the card, said approved and the POS died. The manager insisted it did not go through so tried again, same thing different POS! Finally paid in cash and found been charged twice on my card. Went back, to challenge and they just told us to talk to the bank.

Absolutely will never go again. Side note this used to be a very busy place, I tried to call before for a reservation, but the number listed was not correct. When we arrived at 830pm on a Friday it was nearly empty, this should have been a red flag.More",5.0,2018-08-01,4.0,Pearl Garden

Portions were more than adequate and we even had take away packed for us. Second visit however was on a busy Sunday night. We had reserved a particular table for 5 people but when we arrived, our table had been given out to another family. One of the people in my group was not at all happy and had to tell them off very harshly because we had gone out of our way to reserve that particular table but it seemed as though when they saw that a white family wanted our table, they gave it out. Their excuse for giving out our table was also quite lame. Anyway, so as not to spoil our evening, we had to make do with another table. Our dinner went well and they tried to make up for their earlier mistake by being extra attentive. The food came our piping hot and was delicious as usual. Big portions and we enjoyed it all.

Food
We ended up having one starter and two main courses  The quality of the Kungpao Chicken we ordered as a starter  has really reached a level of excellence rivaling any 5 star Chinese.  The food was  excellent and really very reasonably priced for the level of skills involved.  We also ordered a Nasi Goreng, Singapore Chicken and Kuo Shuji. All cooked to perfection. We rounded off the lunch with Kulay Thod and crispy fried pineapple with ice cream 

What I loved about Pepper Corn Avenue is whether you want a more traditional take on Chinese or really eclectic regional Chinese dishes, you will find them both in this restaurant. Do ask for guidance from the staff who are very well trained and are able to guide people according to their taste buds. My advice when going to Pepper Corn is to try the more exotic sounding dishes rather than sticking to safe choices .

Desserts are excellent and the variety quite stunning for a Chinese restaurant.

What tasted good - chicken & sweet corn soup, salt & pepper ribs & fried wonton. Aside from that, we tried spicy fish, beef in black bean, seafood fried rice, Singapore noodles, crab cakes; the food was all a bit too oily and quite bland. I'd have to say Red needs a new chef.

We sat and ordered drinks. Then I got up to sort out food...for the family.  Rice had only 2 options. Steamed white rice and seafood rice. But the seafood rice was finished! Wow! The Singapore noodles was only enough for one child ...I complained at this point and they promised to make more just for us....

The sauses were either none existent, dried out, finished or cold!! I considered walking out but my children were starving, plain white was better than no food. 

I was hoping desert was better but goodness me what a flop

My last thought was....You can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t possibly go wrong with the drinks at least right? I ordered a Singapore sling which tasted like colored Cough syrup. Disgusting.

5448,Madgie M,"Dear Red,sort out a few things and you'll be 5*.","I booked a table for 9 for my evening birthday dinner.Upon arrival,I apologised for being an hour late and they were very understanding.I soon realised why...at 8:30 pm on a Saturday night the place was practically empty! A family were leaving as we were arriving.I...didn't take this as a poor reflection on them, we are all feeling the economic pinch right now. So,we placed our orders with a VERY attentive and pleasant waiter, he really excelled himself. However,he had no choice but to inform us that prawns (unless premade like in a dumpling etc) and duck were unavailable.
Que??? In a Chinese restaurant?? So that was a downer because I had been craving prawns and broccoli!
The next disappointment was my non-alcoholic cocktail.
I can't recall the name ( smooth lady?? something smooth, I dunno). It looked and tasted like Pepto Bismol!! 
I ""parked"" the vile pink concoction and ordered a Chapman. It was good. you really can't go wrong with Naija's signature tipple!
When the food came, it was verrrrry good. The calamari with salt and pepper was heavenly, as were the chicken wings. The fried rice was amazing, light and non-greasy.The dim sum ( prawn dumplings and wonton) were tasty but miniscule in size. I tried a few mains but I got fed up of spinning that table rotation thingy, it squeaked so loudly, needed some lubricant or something.We were too stuffed for dessert, but we looked at the menu hoping to be tempted. We were informed only fruit salad and ice cream were available. Ugh!
In summary, if they sort out their lack of popular items like prawn and duck,get rid of the squeaky table,make better non-alcoholic cocktails,have dessert readily available,then this restaurant will be perfect! The decor is nice, staff are wonderful, and we actually,all in all had a good time.I would definitely go again, despite the 3* rating which I had to give because the flaws were too significant.More",3.0,2018-04-01,4.0,Red Chinese Restaurant and Lounge

I was there of recent...for lunch with a group of 8, food was served promptly but was not that great. It was regular Chinese that could have been from a less prestigious restaurant without the price tag. It could be due to the fact that it was early afternoon and possibly the main chef not around, which really is no concern of mine as this didn't reflect on our bill. Whatever the time or situation the standard should be upheld.

We had a lovely time wining and dining and it would have ended beautifully so but Rhapsody had to ruin our night when we requested for our bill and they said we couldn't use their POS machine...the only solution was to waddle downstairs like an overfed penguin escorted by the bouncer in tow like a zoo keeper, so me, him and Mrs Kayne had to go to the atm machine downstairs where i withdrew money to settle our bill. They should have informed us from the get go.

Very upset right now and i wont be eating there ever again.

They may have eye pleasing aesthetics but their service tonight is disgraceful, my Mrs is upset with me cos i stopped her from making a scene.

Even more upsetting is learning that they did it because they needed cash to pay their staff salary, so our dining experience was ruined because Rhapsody decided our dining fee would be used to offset staff salary.

SEATING

The new RSVP finally opens after months with glam and elegance to its new look. Some...say the booth system is old and outdated but really RSVP brings it all back to the modern look giving the client the feeling of privacy and allowing one to enjoy an intimate meal. Walking in you can tell you are in a fine dining restaurant. I give it a 9 on 10

But is it only about the look? let's rate the rest.

SERVICE:
We were welcomed in and the manager got us seated immediately. The waiters were on point to bring us the menu and give us a few minutes to look through it. The waiters however do stand right over you. Hard to enjoy a meal with them 1 Meter in front of u. I know they need to be in sight and with the booth system,  it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s hard to get the attention but I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d suggest they walk around every few mins as opposed to standing over the guest.

The staff constantly asks you for a happy weekend. this means they want a tip. Yes, this is very normal in Nigeria but in a fine dining place like RSVP, one would hope this doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t happen. It certainly does not happen at the fine dining restaurant (SLOW) owned by the same chain.

Let's rate this with a 6 on 10.

FOOD:

The tacos were nice and crunchy. The perfect sweet and salty blend to give a mouthwatering experience to the taste. 

The beef carpaccio which is actually Beef Tatar was nice but very salty. Perhaps this was just a one-off. Beef Tatar is one of my favorite dishes so my expectations were perhaps too high. 

The lobster sushi seemed dry but the taste-wise was great.  It does happen and we have experienced this before in other restaurants. perhaps it is the humidity. 

Some think it's easy to make a french fry and all one needs to do is deep fry chips but really there is a whole way of making the perfect chip and RSVP pulled it off fabulously.

We ordered the pot stickers which tasted amazing but I wish they looked as good as they taste,

For food let's rate this a 7 on 10.

DRINKS:

We ordered 2 Bloody Mary‚Äö√Ñ√¥s and the waiter was quite clear that it would take time to make and this was well appreciated. It did taste amazing and I love how RSVP uses fresh tomatoes to make this instead of a packet.

lats rate this a 9 on 10.

Overall experience was pleasant. I would most definitely visit this place again. I look forward to trying the Oysters next.

5775,Lamide21,Great food!,"I had been wanting to eat at Sabor after my sister had raved about it..several times! I pegged it down as an ideal lunch spot on a Sunday after Mass. Many Sundays came and went, still no Sabor.
So finally, a friend‚Äö√Ñ√¥s birthday was coming...up and I decided to take her there the day after her celebration. 
Let me get the negatives out of the way.... Sabor is not signposted. You‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll be squinting and pointing like a fool before you‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll find it. Actually we ended up asking a security guard. Fortunately, it turned out to be the building next door. 
The decor is minimalist but not at all pretensious. It has an intimate and familiar feeling.The space is smaller than I expected but you get a great view of the hustle and bustle of V.I, without the noise.
The staff are EXCELLENT. Friendly and attentive without the nuisance factor.
For drinks, I had a pineapple, coconut cream and lime mocktail. Initially it didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t seem as sweet as I would have liked, but the flavour developed with each sip and it got progressively sweeter.
My calamari starter was delicious. I am obsessed with calamari and often judge a restaurant by the quality of its calamari ( yes, newly refurbished Cactus restaurant, I am looking at you, with your ridiculously thin and tough unhappy looking calamari). The calamari came with a choice of two types of relish. The creamy and spicy one was divine.
For my main, I ordered a chicken salad. The pretty and dimpled cheeked chef came and politely asked if I would like goat‚Äö√Ñ√¥s cheese instead of the feta listed on the menu. They were out of feta. She also suggested other replacement options that I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t quite remember.I opted for the goat‚Äö√Ñ√¥s cheese.
When the salad arrived, I thought it looked quite boring. All the ingredients were arranged neatly in their own section. Nothing had been tossed. I also expected strips of chicken, but all I had were teeny tiny cubes. I sadly poured the dressing, a creamy concoction, over the salad, and resigned myself to a lacklustre lunch.....and then POW! The flavours! This was one of the tastiest salads I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve ever had!! 
Then came dessert. The waiter recommended the nut brownie with salted caramel and vanilla ice cream.Now I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t usually like brownies.And I also know from bitter experience that many of the finest restaurants ,in my beloved Lagos, have consistently let me down when it comes to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫ pudding‚Äö√Ñ√π.
I am pleased to announce that Sabor‚Äö√Ñ√¥s dessert was an absolute triumph. I could go on and on about this place, but I have clearly written more than enough. Thank you Sabor, and bravo!More",4.0,2018-07-01,4.5,Sabor Restaurant

We had an issue at the door because the doorman didn't allow my husband to enter in shorts.
Another day...we could enter, now dressing long trousers but we saw other men wearing shorts there.... Weird rule then. It was only for certain clients ??

5784,IamTheBlessedOne,An embarrassment never to be forgotten,"We came to the Sailors Lounge haven been referred by a good friend. We thoroughly regret it. Never in our lives, as a couple have we been so embarrassed. 

Chairs were physically pulled out of us by a thug who apparently regularly bribes the staff,...he was half naked in scanty agbada. All these in the wide glare of the Manager and Bouncers begging him Instead. 

All we did wrong was that we ordered drinks, asked for a private table to celebrate our wedding anniversary from waiters who didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t seem to care.

Rather than remain standing, we sat on an half empty table with vacant chairs. Only to be accosted by the thug who said he was a regular, and there was nothing he could not get away with, and since he had bought a drink on the same table, he owned the table. 

We were shocked. And just before we could make a move, he pulled the chairs on us and we staggered to avoid falling. We could have fallen into the water, we could have revenged and broken a bottle or something, but we simply paid the bill for the drinks we could no longer take. And just as we walked out, he ran out after us shouting, and threatening to beat us up.

We are just back home now, and they have effectively ruined what started as a great day. 

Thankfully, we were not stabbed or drowned by the untouchable thug at the lounge.

The waitress got the order wrong and told the chef calamari teriyaki. My date had to crosscheck with her...and she argued it until the chef had already prepared it. She later came to tell us that she'd pack the calamari for us at no extra charge as she didn't want her boss to know of her error. During our meal which was amazing the lights went out, for close to 20 minutes, imagine the heat. After the meal she brought the bill, she'd assured that the calamari wasn't on the bill as it was no mistake of ours for me to look at the bill and see it. She took it back and the boss came up to me with an attitude saying that I'd ordered for the calamari what then was the problem. On clarification, she rectified it. To pay with my card, the waitress keyed in the wrong figure which would have been a major loss to them. I had to correct her error and do another transaction for her with the correct amount.

They started an hour later for Christmas Day, but they addressed all of us. The patrons we were gifted appetizer platters to recognize us for being patient with the delayed start. 

Translation: small chops...that included snail which ain't cheap. 

Unlimited Chapman, Sparkling Wine and a whole turkey with smoked lion cut pork chops with a honey bourbon glazed were the premium meat items.
While cheeseburger slider size, various salads and delicious chicken pepper soup were offered. 

They have a great mix of Local Entrees and Western dishes as my entire crowd was appeased. 

Why 5 stars if things were late?
This is and was the 1st place that a member of management or owner checked on us a la American style to ask, ""How are things?"" To get actual feedback is a service that improves the restaurant and helps customers feel appreciated. 

The Singer with the band was wholesome and interacted well with kids and adults. Now, the cherry on this sundae is IF YOU PREPAY YOU SAVE MONEY. This can be problematic for foreigners as we can't transfer like the locals.

5903,adey_naija,"Great Ambience, Good Food","Nicely tucked away off Idejo St behind the Stanbic building in Victoria Island. 

Decor is modern and the space looks well run. I usually use the toilet as it gives you a good idea of how well they might be managing the kitchen space. In...this case, they passed the litmus test..not in flying colours i have to say.

Anyway they have an excellent life jazz band on the day and i hear it is weekly too. Did i hear you say that is not the main reason why you go to a restaurant...I agree with you. So to the food

The restaurant is a curious mix of style; nigerian or local, continental and some form of seafood. The key point here is that they cater to broad range of palate so there is probably something here for everyone. The most important thing in my opinion is that everyone enjoyed their meal so i can recommend the food.

The negative for me was the parking arrangement. I went with a driver so i don't know how he resolved it but there didn't appear to be too much space.

Overall, i think it is a nice, well designed and decorated space that serves a broad range of well cooked tasty meals...and good music accompaniment.More",4.0,2018-06-01,4.5,Scotch Bonnet Restaurant

I was so pleasantly suprised , it is located in Victoria Island and easy to get to. I was put in touch with the owner via their resident MC DJ Young 2 days before my event and Elie was a pleasure to work with. He was detailed oriented and very welcoming just by our phone convo. The day of the event 2hr followed up with me to make sure everything will be in order when I arrived. 

Fast forward to my arrival, I was welcomed warmly by the staff who whisked my cake to the back kitchen and then walked me into the club where I met Elie. He was warm and the atmosphere of the space is very swank club feel witj an open flow and pretty lights. He had my VIP section already/ prepared and worked with his team to situate our order. The order came out quickly unlike other clubs where they drag there feet and act like they are doing you a favor. His staff was extremly attentive and customer service driven. I never had a moment where my needs were not met from drinks to food. The food is very yummy and well made.

The DJ was great as well playing afrobeat favorites and top #trending songs. The rest rooms were clean and fully stocked.

5952,NaijaBabe2016,An Okay Experience.,"Sherlaton Restaurant is a place I've known about for many years, so you could say 'it's reputation precedes it'!Ô£ø√º√≤√ú I first heard about Sherlaton when I used to visit Lagos as a young lady in the early and mid 90s. I've never had the pleasure...of dining here. 4 out of my 4 daughters adore Indian Food, and I was with 2 of them on this visit to Lagos, so it was the perfect opportunity for my maiden visit to Sherlaton Finest Indian Cuisine. It's located in the Cumberland Luxury Hotel, inside a part called Nirvana Lotus Hall. Access to the restaurant is via a short stairway, onto a first floor. The location is a good one- on Adeola Odeku Street/Ahmadu Bello Way- a very central area of Victoria Island. 

The restaurant is expansive, with vibrant Indian accents and decorative artifacts. The decor/furniture looked a bit outdated and old-fashioned, yet orderly and well maintained. Toilets were squeaky clean. I know Sherlaton has been open for a very long time, but I had no idea that they've been operational since 1976! Ô£ø√º√≤‚â§ How remarkable! Our waiter, (didn't catch his name), brought us their first ever menu in a picture frame. Please refer to the posted photo of it. How cool is that!?!? Ô£ø√º√≤√© What an awesome memento/piece of history/snapshot in time. The menu back then was a lot more modest. Ô£ø√º√≤√ë Meanwhile, on Sherlaton's current menu, Monday is Dosa Day, but Indian, Nigerian and Continental Chinese Dishes are still served on this day. They also serve Breakfast- (from 6:30 a.m to 10:30 a.m) daily. Service was impressive. Didn't find any fault as far as any of the staff was concerned. Food came out in a short amount of time.

Sherlaton Restaurant has an extensive menu that includes SOUPS, NIGERIAN CUISINE, INDIAN VEGETARIAN STARTERS, INDIAN NON-VEGETARIAN STARTERS, VEGETARIAN MAIN COURSE, CHEF'S SPECIAL INDIAN THALI (Vegetarian & Non-Vegetarian), RICE, INDIAN BREADS, CONTINENTAL VEGETARIAN STARTERS, NON-VEGETARIAN MAIN COURSE, CHINESE VEGETARIAN, CHINESE NON-VEGETARIAN, RICE & NOODLES, SANDWICHES (Plain/Grilled), ACCOMPANIMENTS, DRINKS, DESSERTS, COCKTAILS, SHOTS, MOCKTAILS, SOFT DRINKS, JUICES and plenty of ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. 

We were not very hungry, having had a rich buffet breakfast at a hotel not too long ago, so we ordered MUTTON SAMOSA, CHICKEN TIKKA ROLLS, CHICKEN SPRING ROLLS as our Starters, and CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA for our Main Course, then a BUTTER NAAN and CHEESE NAAN for our Bread(s). We got the VIRGIN MOJITO for our Drinks. Everything was delicious and tasted very authentic. The pastry for the Mutton Samosas was too dry and a bit on the hard side, but the filling was rich and packed with meaty goodness. 

The Chicken Spring Rolls were yummy, but I thought the pastry would be like the regular thin spring roll pastry, not the oily pakora kind. It tasted like deep fried pancakes. The Cheese Naan wasn't nice because it was too oily. That grease overwhelmed the bread and gave the cheese a weird, plasticky consistency. The Butter Naan on the other hand was soft, buttery and flaky, but in all honesty- I've had better. The Virgin Mojito Mocktail was just okay, slightly overpowered by the plentiful mint in it. Our favourite dish was the Chicken Tikka Rolls! They were juicy, spicy, well seasoned and packed with tons of flavour. 

We enjoyed the food at Sherlaton Restaurant, and I can definitely see myself coming back here to sample many more items from their copious menu. Prices were very reasonable- especially for a city as expensive as Lagos, so kudos to Sherlaton Restaurant for keeping it 'economical'.Ô£ø√º√´√ßÔ£ø√º√®Œ©The food is very decent, even though I must say that I expected a little more from an eatery that's been in business for over 47 years. It was disappointing that they screwed up Naan Bread, which for an Indian Restaurant is not acceptable as far as I'm concerned. This is single-handedly the reason why I couldn't give them a 'very good' rating. Had there been a 'good' rating on TripAdvisor, I'd have gone for that, so it's gonna have to be an average from me for Sherlaton Finest Indian Cuisine. However, I must say that given the fact that they've been open for such a long time, they have to be doing something right, so who the hell cares about what little ol' me has to say about them!!! Ô£ø√º√≤√á Therefore, CONGRATULATIONS to Sherlaton Restaurant for this amazing accomplishment! Ô£ø√º√´√®Ô£ø√º√®¬∫ Ô£ø√º‚Ä¢‚â• An overall decent experience for us, so I'd go ahead and recommend them, albeit- not 'highly'.More",4.0,2023-08-01,4.0,Sherlaton Indian Restaurant

The food was really nothing short of gourmet, and portions size, whilst they looked small at first, they had the perfect size to make us feel well fed. The plates were arranged beautifully, and the vibrant colours of the different dishes that were served looked almost like art.

We ordered Scallops, Eggs Benedict, seafood tacos, lamb chops, Oysters, and a few more.

You cant leave without trying the fresh bloody mary. it is to die for. 

This is a restaurant where you will have a perfect lunch/dinner for every special occasion.

The quality of the ingredients combined fully with impressive creativity from the chef‚Äö√Ñ√¥s team resulted in a series of positive surprises for us all. Many restaurants have menus that have over 100 dishes on them, but I prefer a more limited, clean-to-the-point menu that allows the chef to focus on making the limited dishes the best. 

SLOW rates very high on my restaurant lists in Lagos. My friends & I have eaten there many times and I have always been so pleased with the food, service, and ambiance. The food is exquisite, the service is great and timely and consequently, the pricing is on the high side, but it is well worth it. 

TIP ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ Sunday brunch is perfect as they have a live band.
Tip ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ Try the Oysters, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s amazing but always reserve it in advanceMore",2.0,2022-06-01,4.0,Slow

That set menu was a rip off imo. The quantity was...just too small. It came with  a drink and a  bottle of  water. Tiny plates of 4 different starters for a table of 6/8. The bread and cheese spread was lovely so was the chicken balls. My friend tried the akara (bean cake) and said it was good. French fries and minced meat sauce was the fourth option for starter. The main meal did not go round. I was away and before I got back the rice had finished. I heard the quantity brought was so small it didn't go round and they refused to bring more. The macaroni and cheese for main went mostly untouched and the chicken was very dry. 

A set menu should not be a way of cheating customers. Customers should not leave your restaurant feeling they did not get value for money which was the case here.

The food was ok but I won't be returning here anytime soon. Went home hungry.More",4.0,2018-01-01,4.5,South Eatery and Social House

Everyone is nice enough from answering the phone taking a reservation to welcoming us upon entry although the reserved table wasn't marked for our name. Maybe the accent wasn't understood... No idea. 

But the buffet @ N8,000 with only 1 drink...and no refills. Be warned. They have Pepsi products and their Chapman isn't overly sweet. 

Their dumplings are steamed and served at a separate station which is nice. The accouterments were 5 star great. While the mutton was cooked down like crock pot stew meat which I tried and felt was tasty for my sample. 

Shocked more Naan (bread) options were not available or at least a garlic naan but there's plenty of fish, chicken, veggie options for all palates and dietary restrictions. I dined on a day there was no butter chicken offered. But they provide a rice and a noodle choice. Salad options. 2 desserts. One was cocktail fruit In a warm custard and the other was fried bread in a liquid sugar sauce.

For starters, we had feta rolls and calamari. The calamari had more veg than actual calamari and the dip for the feta rolls was way too spicy for the type of rolls served. We had our steaks medium rare and they were quite tasty although a bit too bloody and chewy for my liking in some parts. The mash was nice and very creamy. The fries had a weird taste as though it had been in the freezer for too long. It was definitely an above average meal and I left there feeling well fed but for the prices, I expected perfection.

7078,antaresa2021,NOT SO GREAT,Alright so i follow a guy on youtube called wode maya and he went to this place and so   i decided if its good enough for the great wode maya it should be good enough for me. first of all let me say the ambience...of the place is excellent. love the bookshop. anyway so i ordered the ofada rice and sauce.the sauce didnt taste that great and there was hardly any meat in it so basically you are paying 3000 naira for just the rice. but i overlooked that and because of the ambience of the place iwent the next day and ordered the club sandwich and like a shandy drink on the menu. the whole thing came to 5000 naira .first of all the shandy was sour. not an ounce of sweetness in it but the real bummer was the club sandwich. as soon as i took a bite i nearly puked. its like they put stale tuna straight from the can into it. it just tasted nasty. after taking that one bite i just ignored the rest of it and just ate the fries. however i wasnt going to waste what i just paid 5000 naira for so i told the guy to bring me an aluminium foil so i could wrap up the sandwich and take it home with me so i can eat it at night when i am fully drunk and dont care about what the food taste like. and thats what i did. got drunk at home because it was a weekend and when i was craving for food during my tipsy state i just ate the rest of the club sandwich.  so all in all i wouldnt be going to this place for food again because i tried it twice and it was rubbish. however this is a great place to bring your friends and sit down and drink coctails. so i wouldnt write it off because the ambience is good and you can just hang out and drink cocktails here. however the food is a miss for me.More,3.5,2021-02-01,4.0,Terra Kulture
7079,Ade703,Good relaxation spot,"Terra Kulture is best known for hosting plays and other artsy events. Located in a central part of Victoria Island, it has played host (and continues to do so) to a range of different stage performances over the years. The second half of the building...also contains a restaurant and book/souvenir store on the ground floor and mini-museum on the upper floor; there you can find on display a wide range of traditional attire from different Nigerian ethnic groups of Nigeria. The food is quite good and with a fair price point, the wait time (~ 45 minutes) however needs to be improved on. 

Overall its a nice place to have a quite lunch or dinner and basically relax.More",4.0,2020-12-01,4.0,Terra Kulture

7083,Tia011,"The food here is very good, but ...","The food here is very good. The dishes are well thought out and well prepared. If marking just on the food the score would be 4.5. There are some inconsistencies and irritations which let the place down. With some tweaks the place would be exceptional...and easily one of the best in Lagos.

The presentation is lovely. The food is tasty and authentic and unlike many establishments, they have resisted the temptation to add incompatible dishes to their menu. This is good quality, local Nigerian food. We are fussy eaters but this place impressed us and we became repeat customers.

The complimentary chin chin and nuts is delicious. It wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t always served with drinks which when you have to wait a long tome for your food is an amateur mistake. 

Areas for improvement:

The delays getting the food on the table can be bad if you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re in a hurry or if you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re hungry.

The mixed meats soup on 2  days was delicious and generous, on another day there were about 2 tiny pieces of meat. We complained and left most of it but we  were still charged.
The ofado sauce lacked variety and wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t completely warm. Lack of consistency irritates me profoundly. 

The menu and the pictures on the website suggest they serve moin moin. When you order it, they tell you they do not.  It remains on the menu and in the online images! 

The closing time on this website says 12am. We went for a late meal, it turns out, they close at 10am even at the weekend. 

The servers are helpful, pleasant and warm but seem a little bit inexperienced. I think there needs to be more staff and more training. 

The new Manager is warm and pleasant. Her priority needs to be to get items not sold off the menu, train staff and review the consistency of food leaving the kitchen. I think it would be worth employing more staff and open later at the weekend. The staff seem shattered towards the end of the day. 

They also need to review their marketing on and offline. If information online is inaccurate - change it! 

All in all, a nice place to eat. The irritations are not off putting because the staff are generally pleasant and eager to please. 

We‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll probably explore other eateries but I hope this place attends to the areas for development. It would easily get 5 stars from us if the issues were addressed!More",2.0,2020-03-01,4.0,Terra Kulture

To their credit the server did take the Chapman we didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t send back away. What came  to replace it wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t a whole lot better. Definitely not a Chapman. 

Food took a while to come. The starters left a lot to be desired. The batter on the prawns was thick and leathery. The hummus wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t anywhere near Double Four standards, wings were over cooked and spicer than promised and disappointingly the yam chips were neither crispy nor fully cooked.

The imprecise cooking continued with the mains, with the burger patties burnt on one side and the lambs chops almost cremated. The steak medallions in the surf and turf were like hockey pucks and all the prawns were rubbery. There were some redeeming elements; the food was well seasoned, and the waitress attentive. Still like the plywood and cheap wood strips used for many of their fixture, weathered and rotting away, the glory of the establishment seems to have been drained in the past few years, perhaps slowing flowing next door.More",4.5,2021-12-01,4.0,The Backyard Bar and Grill

7206,brokematerialgirl,Horrible,"So I remember when backyard first opened. The food was excellent. I made sure everyone I know tried the teriyaki chicken cos it was that good. Chunky strips of chicken done excellently with teriyaki sauce. Fast forward to yesterday- I had a craving for teriyaki...chicken so I braved traffic all the way from marina on a Friday to backyard. First indication of doom- it was empty at 1.30pm, parking lot empty and inside there was only 1 table occupied with 2  people. Everything in my head said RUN!  But I did not. My craving had to be satisfied. So I buy one portion of teriyaki chicken, garden salad and fries to go. 

I get back to the office and it is the most disappointing meal ever. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not teriyaki chicken- it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s teriyaki dough, thick dough smothered in too much teriyaki sauce. When I look at it I think ‚Äö√Ñ√∫this is oddly shaped. Interesting.‚Äö√Ñ√π I take a bite and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m like ‚Äö√Ñ√∫that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not chicken‚Äö√Ñ√π so I look down and examine the crap in my plate.  I literally opened up the thick, doughy exterior to find a tiny strip  of tasteless chicken. A strip thinner than KFC‚Äö√Ñ√¥s chicken strip but not anywhere near appealing to the eyes as KFC‚Äö√Ñ√¥s. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s even slightly pink. Terrible. Most disappointing lunch ever. 

I ended up eating fries and a salad for lunch which they somehow got right. I feel robbed. If I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know what the meal was like a few months before I probably would not feel this disappointed. Exploited. This was daytime robbery.

7275,61joyo,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"I  would HIGHLY recommend that you AVOID this restaurant/bar/lounge. Not only is the service slow,  the staff unprofessional (from servers to managers to administration). I was overcharged N265,500 and none of staff seemed to care about this very serous error on their part. The whole...story is below...

My friends (who were visiting Nigeria for the first time), my husband and I went to the Library on recommmendation. When we arrived, the atmosphere was lively and we were quickly seated. Despite this, we probably waited around 20/25 mins to give our  order and another 30/40 mins to be served.
After paying, the server held on to my card for about 10 mins without explanation and started slowly backing away from the table. I assumed that maybe the charge didn't pass. When I asked her what the issue was and why she was holding on to the card, she asked me to hold on. I had to scold the server before she eventually handed me back the card while showing me the bill. She said nothing so it took me some time to relaize that she had added an extra zero to the bill making the bill 295k instead of 29,500. 
Highly annoyed at her mistake, the fact she somehow didn't think to explain immediately what happened or to apologize, I naturally asked how she planned to refund the overcharged sum (265,500). She asked me write down my name and bank information on a piece of paper and made it seem as if the transfer would be made that night. So we waited to have confirmation of the transfer, which never happened. We somehow now couldn't see/find this particular server anymore. We happened to spot her by the entrance, and seeing my increasing anger and irritation at the situation, my husband and one his friends went to speak to her. 
After 10 mins, I was fed up of waiting and decided to join them. I found them speaking to the manager. My husband, who is usually very calm, was livid - probably because the manager had a severe attitude and didn't really seem to care about what happened. Seeing the situation and my husband's unexpected reaction really pissed me off. The manager, John Maina, offered absolutely no suggestions/solutions. On top of that, he rejected our suggestions for a cash refund (he claimed that the Library didn't deal in cash - even though one of our friends staying at Maison Fahrenheit had seem someone pay in cash the night before) or for a bank transfer made that night (apparently only the accountant could do it and he/she wasn't on-site). 
He assured us that we would see the bank transfer the next morning. Being Nigerian and knowing how Nigerians are, I said that wasn't enough. There was no garantee that the accountant would acknowledge the promises Mr. Maina made. We told him to send us email from his professional account (with the accountant copied) explaining the situation and that a refund was required.
The next day we waited until 1pm and, of course, no transfer was made. So, my husband and I had to go back to speak to someone and make sure the refund was sent. When we finally got to speak to someone in the administrative office (Titi), she was very rude and implied that it was my fault for not looking over the bill before paying. Yes, I could have, and clearly should have, looked over the bill, but to insinute that this was my fault was exteremly unprofessional. Then instead of proceeding to issue the refund, Titi decided that she had more important business to attend to kept us waiting 15/20 mins before finally asking to verify my bank information. At the end of all this wahala, the cheapstakes didn't think it decent to refund me the full 295k for all my troubles.More",1.0,2022-08-01,1.0,The Deck at The Library

7280,foodieforevermore,Falling Standards,"The standards at The Grill by Delis continue to slip. 

What opened up as a chic addition to the fast-growing Island restaurant scene, with a guarantee of a fine dining experience,  has over the last 7 months, declined into an intelligence-deficient establishment  where diffident waiters...make respectful (if curious) enquiries on whether guests  ‚Äö√Ñ√≤would like some groundnut‚Äö√Ñ√¥, as they endure the long wait-times for your meal. Groundnut?. Oh dear. 

For the lucky few who have established ‚Äö√Ñ√≤friendships‚Äö√Ñ√¥ with some waiting staff, one singular roll of bread (often very lonely in the fetching silver bread basket) may be offered to you. Should you dare ask for another roll, you may notice your waiter physically stiffen at your audaciousness. The poor man is probably thinking about how to justify such a request to the kitchen staff. 

Getting proper butter for the lonely bread roll, has also become something of a lottery too; some days you may get a cut out from a giant slab that sits in the kitchen, and on other days you‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll be treated to fine little individual pots straight from France. 

Although prices have remained the same since the Restaurant opened about 18 months ago, portion sizes have generally dwindled in direct partition to the establishments glory. 

Permit me to share a case-study on the  aubergine and mozzarella bake. 

This indulgent starter started off being served as 9 slices of an average-sized aubergine, beautifully plated in 3 stately towers and generously drizzled with pungent pesto. 

Over time, the average-sized aubergine got replaced with its dwarf-sized relation, looking very scant indeed when presented as 3 coin sized piles, in the middle of a suddenly oversized plate. 

And then somewhere along the line it happened.... the 3 dwarf piles were reduced to two. Shots fired. 

But we managed. Because we are in Nigeria and managing is what we do. 

Long-suffering and endurance are traits that our colonial masters programmed us for, and our ‚Äö√Ñ√≤managing‚Äö√Ñ√¥ culture has been ingrained and reinforced by generations of self-serving leaders. 

But our pop-culture hero‚Äö√Ñ√¥s of the day have been pushing us in a different direction. These role models to a youth population long forgotten by the government, have been preaching that we must ‚Äö√Ñ√≤shine our eye‚Äö√Ñ√¥. So I got out my polish as I returned to The Grill yesterday for my favourite, if grossly over-priced,  aubergine bake. 

With my freshly polished contact-lenses in place, as the pristine white serving plate found its place onto the centre of my table, it became immediately obvious to me that tomatoes, cheese, and pesto had been included on the kitchens fast-increasing list of rationed items. And in that moment the obstinate camels back was broken. 

What had in its glory days been a magnificent gooey plate of cheesy aubergine deliciousness lay before me as an unapologetically dry starter, evoking nothing from my senses but pity. As we say in local parlance; ‚Äö√Ñ√≤shame left the kitchen, and caught me‚Äö√Ñ√¥.

Our waiter encouraged my sister and I to articulate our concerns to enable the kitchen ‚Äö√Ñ√≤fix things‚Äö√Ñ√¥. Where to begin? Eventually he went off with a long list of remedial notes, and returned the plate to his kitchen colleagues for an ‚Äö√Ñ√≤uplift‚Äö√Ñ√¥. 

Within 2 minutes the very same plate returned covered in a mountain of grated parmesan cheese, thickly layered for our troubles.

Unbelievable. 

After an additional ten minutes of detailed complaint and furious note taking by the waiter, we wondered why he was so reluctant to have that chef come forward to ‚Äö√Ñ√≤defend‚Äö√Ñ√¥ his meal. As it turned out, there was no chef in the kitchen Ô£ø√º¬ß‚àë‚Äö√Ñ√ß‚Äö√¥√Ñ√î‚àè√®

An extra five minutes passed, and we wondered why the manager hadn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t thought it fit to approach us and address our concerns. As it turned out, the manager too wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t due to arrive for another 45mins Ô£ø√º¬ß‚àë‚Äö√Ñ√ß‚Äö√¥√Ñ√î‚àè√®

The waiters valiantly fought to explain away the multiple failings of the kitchen and management, but at this point the shine in my eyes had given me super vision. 

At some point, a call was placed to one of the ‚Äö√Ñ√≤masters‚Äö√Ñ√¥ and our overworked waiters happily advised us that our un-eaten mess of a meal would not be not included on our bill. We marvelled at the benevolence of the management, and left the waiters a substantial service tip for their efforts. 

As we left to one of the several restaurants in the neighbour, my sister and I took a last look at an establishment that had hosted our weekly catch-up lunches, and family dinners for the past fourteen months. 

At at the end of the day our repeated custom had translated into nothing. It hadn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even been enough to buy us an apology (or extra bread rolls) from the management team. 

Shame left them and caught us. It was a long overdue departure.More",5.0,2019-05-01,4.0,The Grill by Delis

I ordered the jerk chicken and having been to Jamaica several times and being from London can confirm it tasted nothing like jerk chicken!! I was served my meal on a wooded chopping board on top of a banana leaf and given a tiny plate to eat off of. It was very awkward eating chicken and rice of a tiny plate like that. The waitress told me the food came with a jerk sauce but the sauce wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t jerk sauce more of a pepper sauce. My food was cold and as the waitress put my food down she rushed off as I asked her if we could order more drinks and never heard me. No one came to ask if the food was okay. I had to go and find someone to ask if I could order more drinks even tho it was clearly visible our glasses was empty and I was left there eating a meal without a drink. We was charged for alcohol even tho my husband asked for a daqarai without any alcohol. The Shisha was alright. All in all the place is over priced and the customer service is terrible.

I'm not one to leave a negative review but this took the biscuit. After reading the reviews here, I thought this would be a great place to eat, drink and...relax. I even invited a few friends to join me after work.

The place had no signage so when the driver dropped me off, he had to check we were in the right place. I thought 'awesome, I love the mystery!' I came in, and was shown my seat (the kind guy at reception helped me charge my phone). 

I sat and after 15mins of no service, I went to reception to remind them I was here, waiting and hungry, and they said I'd be sorted soon. I went back to sit. Another 15mins passed and then I started to really wonder. 

A couple that came in after me yelled to one of the waiters to be served and after some apology, they brought them a menu. I was alone, not one for shouting so I waited. Looked at my clock. Waited another 15minutes.

I was given no drinks menu not to talk of ordering drinks or food. I wondered how I would get back to my hotel 20mins away but I thought I'd rather faint than spend any time there. I got up and walked to the door. 

The receptionists asked if I had a nice time. I couldn't help but laugh. I told them no (with a smile), I had got no service and I was going to find food anywhere that would serve me. They handed me my phone and I said I'd come back a different day maybe. Of course I won't be back. No one has time to wait around to spend their own money.More",4.0,2019-12-01,4.0,The House

I have been here a few times, one of which was to celebrate a birthday with...friends. And so far have not been disappointed. 
The restaurant is located in the VI annex part of town, so is accessible off Ajose Adeogun. If you're not familiar with that part of town, Google maps should be your friend. 
It is literally located in a house that has barely been converted. So the concept is different rooms, depending on what you are in the mood for. The living room is the general dining room, and then there are offshoots on the ground floor and upstairs, such as the white room, the party room, the cigar room, etc. It doesn't feel like you are in someone's house, but it certainly feels cozy and could work well as a members only clubhouse concept. 
It is a great location for a date, informal business meeting, catch-up with friends, or even small parties in one of the private rooms. 
Back to the food, I've tried many things off the starter menu and my most recent meal was the buttermilk chicken burger with a side of sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries (pictures in the photos below) were the most healthiest portion sizes I think I have ever had. They were huge. And the buttermilk burger was the juiciest chicken burger I've had.

Everyone was very friendly and even the chef and manager came to check on us (it may have helped that we had a local with us).

First things first,...parking was a breeze. They have great parking at the front of the restaurant with security to watch over your car while you are in the restaurant. 

Upon walking into the restaurant, we were sat within 30 seconds of arrival by the host after which the swift and efficient wait staff came to get our orders. The wait staff is really fast and also posses that welcoming feel to serve us. 

The food was fantastic - hands down the BEST club sandwich I have had in the world. Truffles offers an extensive menu of different items such that it was difficult for my husband and I to decide on one meal.

This place is a welcome oasis in what is a not well served area of Ikeja - that said it is never busy and lacks atmosphere because...of that. Frankly, I worry it will still be around in 6 months unless things pick up.

It certainly deserves to prosper, but seems to be struggling to get its name around.

The waiting staff are all super friendly, and unlike other reviewers, I have not had any issues with them. They are really welcoming, remember people and what they drink, which leads to superfast service.

I have eaten there on many occasions, we usually start with drinks and then move onto an alfresco selection of starters - mini burgers, humus and spring rolls are all very tasty and well presented. One criticism, their standard portions are 3, which makes it difficult to divide if your party is even numbered!

We have also enjoyed heir lunch menu, which although unadventurous, delivers what it says on the can - their Club Sandwich is recommended.

Dinner is also good, choose from a selection of steaks, curries and other international items.

In summary, this place deserves to do better, it just needs to raise its profile, as what it has to offer is a nice alternative to the well known 21B just around the corner.More",3.0,2016-09-01,3.0,Truffles Restaurant and Bar
7510,Captain-StuABZ,Started okay but going downhill rapidly.,"Several work colleagues had mentioned the opening of this restaurant close to our company accommodation in Ikeja. The reviews were mixed so myself and a colleague decided to try it out for ourselves.  We visited and although we were the only patrons we were told...that Mondays were always quiet.  We both ordered the hummus which arrived with a generous helping of Lebanese bread and was both good value and pleasant tasting. Our initial choices of mains were not available so we opted for the French mushroom steak and the Thai green curry.  Neither were outstanding but perfectly acceptable and with an absence of restaurants locally we were more or less pleased.  We had 2 bottles of wine from a very limited selection (wines are listed as either red or white and nothing else) which were over priced at 6000N each.  All in all was okay.  However, all that was to change on a subsequent visit just 5 days later.

Hoping for more atmosphere we went back the following Saturday. A different waiter this time with some serious neglect for personal hygiene and so shy it was excruciating trying to order.  The wine was poured but quite a different bottle and quite off and trying the red was equally unpleasant as it was over 30 degrees in temperature. The hummus was equally nice but again our initial choice of mains was unavailable, in fact as absent as any other patrons, even at 8pm on a Saturday night.  We opted for the trio of mini burgers and a sweet and sour chicken in the end as our third and fourth choices stopping short of asking ""what do you actually have on?""  The chicken had burnt cashews and a 3 day old taste and the burgers were undercooked and greasy.  We left quickly, leaving the undrunk wine and made for some fresh air.

At the prices charged here you would expect a high end dining experience, it's comparable with many European restaurants on a price point if not higher but for less you will find much better and waiting staff who keep themselves less ""naturally fragrant"". 

The decor is reasonably smart and there is an outdoor eating area although very dimly lit and the interior is nicely air conditioned but the prices are well in excess of what they should be charging and sadly the quality lets them down.  It's a shame as they have tried hard with several themed nights, live music on Wednesdays and an aviation night with a good discount (20%) on a Thursday but it's not enough if the quality and menu availability isn't to be found.More",5.0,2016-04-01,3.0,Truffles Restaurant and Bar

7523,KITTAPPA,Buon cibo ristorante,"I can be extremely picky/critical when it comes to restaurants and where I spend family time. Enter Umutu to the rescue!! Immediately you drive in, there is a certain non commercial warmth and an ambience that immediately opens your appetite before you even set eyes...on food. 
MUSIC- Enjoy a space where you can chat as music plays in the background without drowning your conversation
AMBIENCE-  Family time, Business meeting, exclusive setting or just hanging out with friends... Umutu has several areas set up accordingly for you to visit over and over.
STAFF- Staffing is an area that continues to be developed in Nigeria. The mindset of individuals in Lagos needs extreme honing- not entirely to be written off at Umutu as they are neat, respectful and provide a decent knowledge of their menu...however there is still some work to be done on a few.
FOOD- For someone whose 1st choice for food won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t be Italian, Umutu showed up and Italian food was sold to me. They have THE best spaghetti you will ever try. Every stomach deserves flavour filled meals and I truly dislike bland food. I never had to worry about this as everything I had a taste of(and I did taste a lot) was remarkable. 
DRINKS- I had heard of Radler beer which I wanted to taste and although they didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have stock, there was an in house wine recommended to me that paired perfectly with my meal.
Umutu is a gem that deserves more recognition than it currently enjoys and I recommend it to anyone who seeks great food and service.More",5.0,2018-05-01,4.5,Umutu Restaurant

I expected it to be heaving with people but I think my friend and I were the only two people there (in fairness it was an election Saturday which have materially affected the number of...customers). There was no music playing when we entered but having sat down the music started. I asked if they could turn it off and was told that they couldn't (as the only people there, their refusal begs question about their customer responsiveness),

The menu is varied and covers burgers, chicken, steaks and a bunch of other foods. I selected the Sticky Chilli Beef with Jollof Rice, my friend opted for the Utopia Burgert and fries. Given that the restaurant was not busy there was a long wait for the food to arrive.

When it did arrive the Chilli beef was ok but not spectacular. It was not particularly spicy but was sticky and was beef!! The portion size was ok. The Jollof rice was bland. My friend enjoyed his Utopia burger which included ham and egg.

The price for a burger is more than you would pay at Johnny Rockets and not as good. The chilli beef is more than you would pay st s medium priced Chinese restaurant and not as good.

There's nothing significantly bad about this place. Maybe going at a busier time would have made the atmosphere more conducive to a positive customer experience.

The Not so Good:...A little pricey. This probably stems from next point. 

The place is on a pretty hidden part of VI. Not on a major road like many other places. As such I figure the turnover is low and maybe this causes prices to be higher than it might be to meet fixed costs.More",3.5,2018-08-01,4.0,Utopia

7621,Colleend55,Pleasantly Delightful,"I usually don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t write reviews but I felt compelled to give a shout out to Velvett. I organised son‚Äö√Ñ√¥s 19th B day party at this venue.
VENUE: Velvett is a Restaurant / lounge - Amazing Ambience, really lit Vibe. Well maintained decor and furniture.  Bonus...is that the place can turn into your own personal night club as has a large Dj booth  (you can bring your own DJ) tucked away in one corner, walled in Glass, so does not affect the flow and vibe of the restaurant. 
CONTACT: The Manager Mr. Johnson was just great - very personable, approachable, knew his job as Manager and you could tell, he is from
the school of thought of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫the customer is always right‚Äö√Ñ√π, when dealing with patrons unlike a large number of his counterparts found in Lagos restaurants. I also had brief contact with a Mario - ‚Äö√Ñ√∫the Oga below the oga at the top‚Äö√Ñ√π. Though our contact was brief, he had an air of being accommodating in his manner. 
Mr Johnson and I, talked through order of service for the party, food menu and beverage options both alcoholic and non alcoholic. He was very insightful on quantities and the restaurant was honest in its final bill to us. 
FOOD: Their menu is really very good it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not a fine dining restaurant but still very good with an eclectic mix of meat, and seafood dishes, also imbued with a good variety of Lebanese dish options including the availability of shisha.  I would describe their menu genre as ‚Äö√Ñ√∫elevated‚Äö√Ñ√π comfort food - food that makes you feel not good but REALLY good. The birthday party food was a good selection of meats and poultry, salads and seafood - in a generous quantity - no skimping there - I am told by guests there was a lot of food but non went to waste.  

Would definitely use venue again and even eat there for ‚Äö√Ñ√∫elevated‚Äö√Ñ√π comfort food.  I hope they maintain their current plateau but of course any improvement like say corkage on alcohol for weekday events would be a corker!More",1.0,2018-04-01,4.5,Vellvett Grill Lounge and Bar

 I and my friend were new to the Asian fusion scene and so, our waiter, Mr. Anthony (who I...highly recommend) pointed out some dishes for us to try out. We followed his advice and had a blast with the meals we ordered‚Äö√∫¬Æ

We had the prawn spring rolls as the starter dish. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d rate this a 10/10. It was hot, crispy and with every bite, I got a delicious mouthful of creamy prawns. 

For our main dishes, I had the ginger beef tenderloin and Jasmin rice (9/10). The beef was tender and the sauce was really tasty. My friend had the Tandoori wings and fried rice (as a side), It came in a platter, with naan bread, pepper sauce and a fresh salad. We both had wine to finish up our meals. And we enjoyed every bit of our experience. 

P.s: It was my friend birthday and when we told Mr. Anthony, they sent to our table a slice of moist cake. 

Total bill was N50,400 (inclusive of VAT) for 2 persons and the portions were so filling, we had to pack the rest up to go.

 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d rate this restaurant 5 stars and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll definitely be back for another visit!More",5.0,2023-10-01,5.0,Wakame Restaurant

It was easy to reserve a table. Staff have...good customer service skills and confirmed my booking quickly, checking in with me  again on the day of the dinner.

Located in the high brow area of Victoria Island the restaurant is definitely upscale. The security staff are polite and very friendly, the front of house staff/waiters were also courteous, paid attention to detail and gave me a lovely birthday sing along...

As I had a booking for 10 people - guests were required to choose from one of three set menus which included a range of vegetarian and meat options. One of my guests decided that she preferred the standard menu as opposed to the set and after speaking to the manager he allowed this in his discretion. 

I would highly recommend the seafood options - I had the calamari starter and char grilled king prawns with linguine main... Absolutely beautiful. Portion sizes are good too. The passion loft cocktail was a winner for me (I had 3). I really wanted to try the apple crumble desert but I was already full. 

The ambiance was charming, we were seated in a sheltered area which gave a cosy private feel. 

I have a sensitive stomach so eating out in Lagos can be difficult, however my meal didn't upset my stomach so I would highly recommend for anyone who's back in Lagos from abroad.

The setting is a modern and clean decor and there is always a beautiful crowd and great ambiance. Reservations are...a must, particularly for dinner on Mondays, where it is one of the few (only?) high end restaurants operating.

The menu is a mix of refined comfort food and classics with a twist. I have tasted many items on it and can recommend most of them. The calamari appetiser ,quinoa salad and king prawns are some of my go-to picks. Prices are on the higher side but very much in line with other restaurants of this standard. The staff are attentive and knowledgeable and the owner couple (husband in the kitchen, wife out front) are always around to ensure everything is running smoothly.
